# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# ðŸš¨ MANDATORY SESSION STARTUP PROTOCOL

## CRITICAL: READ THESE FILES IN EXACT ORDER BEFORE ANY WORK

Every new Claude session MUST read these files in this exact sequence:

1. **`docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`** - ESSENTIAL AI behavior rules and project status
2. **`docs/README.md`** - Current AI Decision Platform strategy  
3. **`docs/essential-business-data.md`** - Business strategy and validation approach
4. **`docs/operations/current-status.md`** - Current phase priorities
5. **`CLAUDE.md`** - This file (additional AI guidance)

## CRITICAL AI BEHAVIOR RULES (ENFORCE IMMEDIATELY)

### ðŸš« NEVER CREATE THESE FILES:
- summary.md, recap.md, session-summary.md
- test-results.md, analysis.md, findings.md
- todo.md, next-steps.md, action-items.md
- Duplicate files with version numbers (file-v2.md, file-final.md)

### âœ… REQUIRED BEHAVIORS:
- **UPDATE-ONLY POLICY**: Modify existing files freely, never create duplicates
- **ASK PERMISSION**: ONLY before creating NEW files (updates require NO permission)
- **VALIDATION-FIRST**: Customer development drives all decisions
