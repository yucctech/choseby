### CUSTOMER CONTEXT: Healthcare Teams Priority
Healthcare teams need anonymous input collection to eliminate politics, conflict detection to show disagreements, professional documentation for compliance.

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FROM VALIDATION:
- **Multi-tenant team isolation** (Row Level Security)
- **Anonymous scoring system** (private evaluations)
- **Conflict detection algorithm** (identify disagreements)
- **Professional export** (board-ready documentation)

## CRITICAL AI BEHAVIOR RULES (ENFORCE IMMEDIATELY)

### ðŸš« NEVER CREATE THESE FILES:
- summary.md, recap.md, session-summary.md
- test-results.md, analysis.md, findings.md
- todo.md, next-steps.md, action-items.md
- Duplicate files with version numbers (file-v2.md, file-final.md)

### âœ… REQUIRED BEHAVIORS:
- **UPDATE-ONLY POLICY**: Modify existing files freely, never create duplicates
- **ASK PERMISSION**: ONLY before creating NEW files (updates require NO permission)
- **CUSTOMER-FIRST**: Build features that enable pilot customer usage immediately

## SUCCESS CRITERIA âœ…

```sql
-- Variance threshold >2.5 identifies team disagreements
SELECT 
  option_id, criterion_id,
  STDDEV(score) as variance,
  CASE 
    WHEN STDDEV(score) > 2.5 THEN 'high'
    WHEN STDDEV(score) > 1.5 THEN 'medium'  
    ELSE 'low'
  END as conflict_level
FROM evaluation_scores
GROUP BY option_id, criterion_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2;
```
