## üö® CRITICAL: READ THESE FILES IN EXACT ORDER BEFORE ANY WORK

Every new Claude Code session MUST read these files in this exact sequence:

1. **`.claude/session-start.md`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY FIRST READ** - Session start procedure & verification requirements
2. **`.claude/completion-checklist.md`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY VERIFICATION SYSTEM** - Prevents false completion claims
3. **`docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`** - ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL AI BEHAVIOR RULES** - NEVER claim completion without running tests
4. **`docs/technical/implementation-summary.md`** - **"CLAUDE CODE START HERE"** - Complete implementation guide
5. **`docs/technical/api-specifications.md`** - Complete REST API endpoint specifications
6. **`docs/technical/database-schema.md`** - PostgreSQL schema ready for implementation
7. **`docs/technical/frontend-components.md`** - React component specifications with customer response workflows

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER CLAIM COMPLETION WITHOUT RUNNING TESTS

**Before marking ANY task complete, you MUST:**
```bash
cd backend
make local  # Fast validation (10 sec)
make test   # All tests (unit + integration)
```

**RED FLAGS - Stop if you see yourself doing these:**
- ‚ùå "Tests created" ‚â† "Tests passing"
- ‚ùå "Code compiles" (`go build`) ‚â† "Code works" (`make test`)
- ‚ùå "Migration file created" ‚â† "Migration applied to database"
- ‚ùå Marking Week/Sprint complete without running integration tests

**This rule was added after Week 1 failure: Claimed completion without running tests or applying migration.**
