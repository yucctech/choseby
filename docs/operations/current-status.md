## Transition Plan to Claude Code

### Design-First Execution Handoff Preparation
**Phase 0 Design Validation Ready:**
- CEO wireframe templates and UX principles definition
- AI-generated mockups aligned with CEO vision
- Customer validation interviews with design feedback integration
- Locked design system and component library specifications

**Technical Implementation Ready:**
- Complete development roadmap with validated design specs
- AI model setup instructions (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B)
- Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind tech stack decisions
- Database design and authentication requirements aligned with approved UX flows

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Market Validation Risks
- **Concept Risk**: AI platform concepts may not resonate with target customers
- **Pricing Risk**: $21.50/user pricing may require strong value demonstration
- **Competition Risk**: Existing tools (Monday.com, Notion) may add decision features
- **Mitigation**: Test multiple concepts before building, validate pricing with high-value customers

### Technical Execution Risks
- **AI Integration Complexity**: DeepSeek R1 local processing may have performance issues
- **Development Timeline**: AI features may extend development beyond simple templates
- **Cost Management**: AI operational costs need monitoring vs local processing savings
- **Mitigation**: Start with concept validation, phased AI integration, local processing priority

### Customer Development Status
**Previous Interview Results Reference**: Earlier customer validation provided valuable insights but needs revalidation for AI platform concepts
**Interview #9 Healthcare Feedback**: Established baseline for simple template preferences
**Next Phase**: Test AI platform concepts against simple template preference to determine market direction

## Success Metrics & Timeline

### Immediate Metrics (Next 4 Weeks)
- **Concept Validation**: Which AI approach resonates with high-value customers
- **Pricing Acceptance**: Validate $21.50/user pricing for chosen concept
- **Customer Segment**: Identify optimal customer profile for AI platform
- **Technology Validation**: Confirm DeepSeek R1 performance for chosen concept

### 6-Month Targets (Flexible Based on Validation)
