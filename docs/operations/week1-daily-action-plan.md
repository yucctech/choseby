## Risk Monitoring Week 1

### Technical Risks
- **DeepSeek R1 Performance**: If >5 second responses, implement API rotation
- **Development Velocity**: If falling behind, increase AI assistant usage
- **Hardware Issues**: RTX 3070Ti driver updates if AI performance issues

### Customer Development Risks  
- **Low Response Rates**: If <10% LinkedIn response, adjust messaging/targeting
- **Interview Quality**: If insights unclear, refine interview script
- **Geographic Challenges**: If time zones difficult, focus on similar time zones first

### Execution Risks
- **Time Management**: If falling behind schedule, prioritize core deliverables
- **Token Limits**: Rotate between multiple AI assistants every 5 hours
- **Burnout Prevention**: Maintain 8-hour daily limit with clear start/end times

**Week 1 Target Outcome**: Technical foundation operational + customer development pipeline started + clear validation of aggressive timeline feasibility
