- [ ] **Professional documentation export** (summary generation, multiple formats)

#### Component Library Setup
- [ ] **Design system tokens** (colors, typography, spacing for professional appearance)
- [ ] **Shadcn/ui component selection** (forms, buttons, cards, navigation)
- [ ] **Mobile-responsive layouts** (executives need mobile access)
- [ ] **Professional styling** (suitable for healthcare/business environments)

**Timeline**: Wireframes by Wednesday, components by Friday
**Blocker Risk**: Medium - Development can start with basic wireframes
**Success Criteria**: Development team has clear interface specifications to implement

### üíª DEVELOPMENT TEAM TASKS - Implementation Ready
**Priority**: Ready to execute once CTO foundation is complete

#### Week 1 Development Priorities
- [ ] **Development environment setup** (local project running, database connected)
- [ ] **Authentication system implementation** (NextAuth.js integration, team-based sessions)
- [ ] **Basic team management** (create team, invite members, role assignment)
- [ ] **User interface implementation** (team dashboard, navigation, basic forms)

- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment)
- [ ] **Error monitoring** (Vercel Analytics, error tracking setup)

**Timeline**: Environment setup Wednesday, basic features by Friday
**Blocker Risk**: Low - Can work in parallel once CTO provides foundation
**Success Criteria**: Team creation and member invitation working in development

### üìä PM TASKS - Customer Conversion & Coordination  
**Priority**: Critical - Customer revenue validates development decisions

#### Pilot Customer Conversion
- [ ] **Contact validation interview customers** (5 strongest healthcare + professional services)
- [ ] **Draft pilot customer agreement** (standard platform, 50% pricing, 3-month commitment)
- [ ] **Schedule pilot customer calls** (get 3 signed agreements by Friday)
- [ ] **Customer feedback workflow** (weekly calls, usage tracking, feature prioritization)

#### Project Coordination
- [ ] **Development milestone tracking** (GitHub project board, budget monitoring)
- [ ] **Team communication setup** (daily standups, weekly customer feedback integration)
- [ ] **Risk monitoring** (Week 4 checkpoint criteria, contingency planning)
- [ ] **Customer acquisition prep** (testimonial collection, referral program planning)

**Timeline**: Customer outreach starts immediately, agreements by Friday
**Blocker Risk**: Medium - Development continues regardless, but revenue validation critical
**Success Criteria**: 3 pilot customer agreements signed with payment commitment

## RISK MONITORING & CONTINGENCIES

### Technical Risks
**Database/Auth Complexity**: If setup takes longer than expected, use Firebase for rapid prototyping
**Team Coordination**: If remote development causes delays, increase pair programming sessions
**Feature Scope**: If anonymous input proves complex, start with simple named scoring for pilots

### Business Risks  
**Customer Conversion**: If pilots hesitate, offer 1-month trial vs 3-month commitment
**Feature Expectations**: If customers expect customization, clarify standard platform approach
**Timeline Pressure**: If Week 1 falls behind, cut UI polish to focus on core functionality

### Market Risks
**Competition Discovery**: If competitors announce similar features, accelerate customer conversion
**Customer Urgency Fade**: If "tomorrow if possible" enthusiasm wanes, prioritize immediate value
**Budget Concerns**: If pilot customers question pricing, emphasize ROI vs expensive coordinat
