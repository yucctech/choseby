# Evaluation Workflow Analysis - Critical Findings

## Database Constraint Discovery
```sql
UNIQUE CONSTRAINT: evaluations_decision_id_evaluator_id_option_id_criteria_id_key
```

This enforces: **One evaluation per (decision, evaluator, option, criterion)**

## Handler Logic (CORRECT)
```go
// Lines 56-75: evaluations.go
1. Check if user has existing evaluations for this decision
2. If yes, DELETE all existing evaluations for this (decision, evaluator) pair
3. INSERT new evaluations
```

This implements **re-evaluation** - same user can update their scores.

## E2E Test Issue (INCORRECT ASSUMPTION)

**Current Test Behavior**:
```javascript
// Uses SAME auth token for all 3 "team members"
await submitTeamMemberEvaluation(1, scores1); // Demo user submits 12 evals
await submitTeamMemberEvaluation(2, scores2); // Demo user RE-submits (DELETE + INSERT)
await submitTeamMemberEvaluation(3, scores3); // Demo user RE-submits again
// Result: Only 12 evaluations (last submission)
```

**Expected Production Behavior**:
```javascript
// Three DIFFERENT team members with DIFFERENT tokens
Member1 (token1) submits → 12 evaluations
Member2 (token2) submits → 24 evaluations total
Member3 (token3) submits → 36 evaluations total
```

## Root Cause
Test simulates "3 team members" using same user account, which triggers re-evaluation logic instead of accumulation.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix Test (Create 3 Users)
```javascript
// Create 3 team member accounts
const token1 = await createMember('member1@test.com');
const token2 = await createMember('member2@test.com');
const token3 = await createMember('member3@test.com');

// Each member evaluates with their own token
await submitEvaluation(token1, scores1);
await submitEvaluation(token2, scores2);
await submitEvaluation(token3, scores3);
```

### Option 2: Accept Test Shows Re-evaluation
Document that E2E test demonstrates re-evaluation feature, not multi-user workflow.

## Verdict
**Handler is working correctly**. Database constraint + DELETE logic = proper re-evaluation support.

Test needs fixing OR documentation update to clarify what it's testing.
