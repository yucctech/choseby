#### Key Quotes
- "This is still vendor selection methodology. For our office expansion decision, I need market analysis, competitive landscape, regulatory environment"
- "I could probably get something similar by asking ChatGPT 'create vendor evaluation criteria'"
- "We already spend $4,500 annually on tools. This looks useful 4-5 times per year - tough ROI calculation"
- "Post-Series A, our board reviews every software purchase over $10K"

#### Critical Value Gap Identified
- **Strategic vs Tactical**: Platform positioned for vendor selection, CEO needs strategic decision support
- **Team Decision Missing**: No multi-stakeholder workflow for complex business decisions
- **Individual vs Collaborative**: Single-user framework creation doesn't address startup decision dynamics
- **Framework vs Process**: Generated good criteria but lacks decision execution workflow

#### Pricing Reality Check
- **Price Point**: $21.50/user/month ($17K annually for leadership team)
- **Budget Context**: More than entire $4,500 productivity stack combined
- **Authority Process**: Board approval + legal review + security assessment (3-month timeline)
- **ROI Challenge**: 3-4 major decisions annually vs $17K cost requires strategic value

#### Competitive Positioning Weaknesses
- **Free Alternatives**: "ChatGPT could probably generate similar frameworks"
- **Current Process**: "Excel plus consultant when needed works pretty well"
- **Tool Stack**: "Notion templates could handle the scoring"
- **Consultant Comparison**: "$5K-10K consultant gives strategic thinking, not just frameworks"

#### Critical Missing Features Identified
**Team Decision Workflow**: 
- Multi-stakeholder input collection (CEO, CTO, CFO, Head of Operations)
- Conflict resolution when stakeholders disagree on priorities
- Decision audit trail for board presentations
- Collaborative scoring and discussion facilitation

**Strategic Decision Support**:
- Market analysis frameworks beyond vendor selection
- Competitive landscape evaluation templates
- Investment decision matrices with financial modeling
- Risk assessment and scenario planning capabilities

#### Market Research Validations
- **Tool Fatigue**: Previous Monday.com/Notion failures create platform skepticism
- **Budget Discipline**: Post-funding boards scrutinize software purchases >$10K
- **Procurement Friction**: Complex approval processes for B2B software
- **Alternative Preference**: Excel + consultants for major strategic decisions

#### Overall Assessment
- **Value Fit**: MIXED ⚠️ - Good tactical framework quality, insufficient strategic capability
- **Pricing Acceptance**: NEGATIVE ❌ - $17K too high for current tactical positioning
- **Market Validation**: CONDITIONAL ⚠️ - Requires team decision + strategic features for CEO segment
