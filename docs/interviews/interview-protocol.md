## INTERVIEW SCRIPT TEMPLATE

### Opening (2-3 minutes)
```
Hi [Name], thank you for joining me to test our AI decision framework tool. I'm [Your name] from Kryver.

We've built a prototype that helps business teams create custom decision evaluation templates in minutes instead of hours. Since you mentioned you're currently [decision context], this should be perfect timing.

This will take about 15-20 minutes. I'll have you test our live prototype with your actual [decision type], then get your feedback. You'll keep the framework we generate.

Tell me a bit about your current [decision] - what's driving the need to [change/select/evaluate]?
```

### Prototype Demonstration (10-12 minutes)
1. **Navigate to http://localhost:3000/**
2. **Let customer choose**: Manual input OR demo example that matches their situation
3. **Guide through all 6 steps**: Decision input → Context questions → Generated template → Customization → Export → Feedback
4. **Observe reactions**: Note completion rate, engagement level, value recognition

### Key Observation Points
- **Completion Rate**: Do they finish entire workflow?
- **Value Recognition**: Positive reactions to generated template?
- **Engagement Level**: Time spent customizing, asking questions?
- **Export Behavior**: Do they download/save the template?

### Post-Demo Interview Questions (5-8 minutes)

#### Immediate Reaction
- "What's your immediate reaction to the framework it generated?"
- "How does this compare to how you normally approach this type of decision?"
- "What would you change or add to make this more useful?"

#### Value Assessment  
- "Would you actually use this template for your current decision?"
- "What's the biggest advantage of this approach over your current process?"
- "How much time would this save you compared to building evaluation criteria manually?"

#### Pricing Validation
- "What do you currently spend on decision support?" (consultants, tools, time)
- "At $21.50/user/month for your team, how do you feel about that pricing?"
- "What would justify that cost for your organization?"
- "Who else in your organization would find this valuable?"

#### Competitive Context
- "What tools do you currently use for important business decisions?"
- "How would you describe this to a colleague who asked for recommendations?"
