# INTERVIEW #4 EXECUTION PROMPT - CORRECTED METHODOLOGY

**CONTEXT**: This interview corrects critical protocol violations identified in Interview #3 CEO validation review. We discovered fundamental pricing and positioning issues that require validated testing with corrected methodology.

## PROJECT BACKGROUND SUMMARY
**Kryver**: SMB decision support platform, framework-based approach, $50K total budget, 18-month runway
**Current Challenge**: Interview #3 revealed 2.16x pricing sticker shock ($4,320 vs $1,500-2,000 expected) and competitive positioning crisis
**Key Finding**: Users see value in decision frameworks but price sensitivity much higher than assumed

## INTERVIEW #3 CRITICAL FAILURES TO CORRECT
1. **Protocol Violation**: Interviewer helped user at 1:28, not required 3:00 threshold
2. **Invalid Test Conditions**: Static wireframes with CRM examples instead of dynamic content
3. **Insufficient Pricing Pressure**: Didn't probe hard on budget reallocation reality
4. **Competitive Analysis Gap**: User combined Monday.com + Notion costs vs our standalone pricing

## INTERVIEW OBJECTIVE  
Validate corrected pricing model ($2,400 annually) and test competitive displacement against individual tools (not combined stacks) using strict unguided protocol.

## MANDATORY PERSONA SELECTION (Different Industry)
**Select ONE - NO Marketing Agencies**:
- **Option A**: Dental Practice Operations Manager (40 employees) - Service industry, compliance-focused
- **Option B**: Small Law Firm Practice Administrator (35 employees) - Risk-averse, documentation-heavy
- **Option C**: Regional Accounting Firm Operations Director (45 employees) - Process-oriented, cost-conscious

*Randomly select one persona and embody completely with industry-specific language*

## STRICT TESTING PROTOCOL - ZERO DEVIATIONS

### PHASE 1: CORRECTED UNGUIDED TASK TESTING (15 minutes)
**Present Scenario**: "Your company needs to make an important business decision - could be vendor selection, office location, new service offering. I'm going to show you a decision support tool. Set up the decision process. I'll only help if you're completely stuck for 3 full minutes."

**CRITICAL PROTOCOL CHANGES**:
- ✅ **STRICT 3-MINUTE RULE**: Count to 180 seconds before any help
- ✅ **FUNCTIONAL PROTOTYPE**: Content must match user's decision input dynamically  
- ✅ **ZERO EXPLANATIONS**: No feature descriptions, pure task observation
- ✅ **PRECISION TIMING**: Record exact minutes:seconds for each screen

**Show Wireframes**: Start with Screen 1, user navigates independently
**Observation Focus**: Record every hesitation, confusion, wrong click, abandonment moment

**Success Criteria**: User completes vendor/location/service decision setup in under 12 minutes with fewer than 3 major confusion points.

### PHASE 2: CORRECTED PRICE TESTING (8 minutes)
**Present CORRECTED Annual Cost**: "$2,400 annually for your team size" (40 users x $5/month)
**Budget Reality Probe**: "What would you need to cut from your current budget to afford $2,400?"
**Authority Validation**: "Who actually approves $2,400 software purchases?"
**Timeline Testing**: "How long would budget approval take for a $2,400 annual tool?"

**Success Threshold**: Neutral to positive pricing reaction, can identify funding source

### PHASE 3: INDIVIDUAL TOOL COMPETITIVE TEST (7 minutes)
**CORRECTED APPROACH**: Test against ONE tool, not combined stacks
- If they use Monday.com: "How does $2,400/year for decision frameworks compare to what you pay Monday.com for project management?"
- If they use Notion: "How does $2,400/year for structured decisions compare to your Notion workspace costs?"
- If they use Google Workspace: "How does $2,400/year compare to your Google Workspace + current decision-making process?"

**Displacement Questions**:
- "If you had to choose: keep [current tool] or switch to this decision platform, which would you pick?"
- "What would convince you to add $2,400/year for better decision-making on top of [current tool]?"

## SUCCESS METRICS - CORRECTED TARGETS

### Usability (Unguided Performance)
- **Task Completion**: Under 12 minutes for decision setup (Interview #3 baseline: 10:02)
- **Confusion Points**: Fewer than 3 major hesitations or wrong turns  
- **Protocol Compliance**: ZERO help before 3-minute threshold
- **Content Validity**: Dynamic responses to user's actual decision input

### Pricing Reality (Corrected Model)
- **Initial Reaction**: Neutral to positive response to $2,400 annual
- **Funding Source**: Can identify what they'd reallocate or cut
- **Authority Process**: Understands approval workflow for $2,400 purchases
- **Timeline**: Realistic approval timeframe (not "I'll need to think about it")

### Competitive Positioning (Individual Tool Focus)
- **Value Recognition**: Sees decision framework value vs current tool limitations
- **Switching Logic**: Can articulate why they'd pay extra for decision support
- **Integration Expectation**: Understands this supplements, doesn't replace current tools
- **Displacement Willingness**: Would consider adding $2,400 for decision frameworks

## PERSONA EXECUTION REQUIREMENTS

### Dental Practice Manager (Option A):
- **Language**: "Patient care efficiency", "compliance documentation", "staff decision consistency"
- **Budget Reality**: "Insurance reimbursements are tight", "Need clear ROI on patient throughput"
- **Decision Examples**: New equipment purchases, staff scheduling systems, compliance software

### Law Firm Administrator (Option B):
- **Language**: "Client confidentiality", "partner approval process", "billable hour efficiency"  
- **Budget Reality**: "Partners scrutinize every expense", "Need documented cost-benefit"
- **Decision Examples**: Case management software, office relocations, new practice areas

### Accounting Firm Operations Director (Option C):
- **Language**: "Tax season efficiency", "client workflow", "regulatory compliance"
- **Budget Reality**: "Seasonal cash flow considerations", "Per-client cost allocation"
- **Decision Examples**: Tax software, client portal systems, seasonal staffing

## POST-INTERVIEW VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### Performance Documentation
- **Exact Timing**: MM:SS for each screen transition
- **Confusion Log**: Every hesitation with timestamp and resolution
- **Protocol Compliance**: Confirmation of 3-minute rule adherence
- **Content Validation**: Proof that wireframes matched user's decision input

### Business Intelligence  
- **Pricing Response**: Verbatim reaction to $2,400 annual cost
- **Budget Source**: Specific items they'd cut or reallocate
- **Approval Process**: Names and timeline for $2,400 software approval
- **Competitive Value**: Specific advantages vs their current individual tool

### Success Validation
- **Usability Threshold**: <12 minutes, <3 confusion points achieved?
- **Pricing Acceptance**: $2,400 received neutral/positive reaction?
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Clear value articulation vs current tool?
- **Implementation Confidence**: Realistic rollout plan identified?

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**This Interview Must Prove**:
1. **Corrected pricing ($2,400) eliminates sticker shock**
2. **Users can navigate without guidance when content is functional**  
3. **Decision framework value is clear vs individual tool limitations**
4. **Implementation pathway exists within SMB resource constraints**

**If This Interview Fails**: Fundamental product-market fit assumptions require immediate reassessment before further development investment.

**Methodology Validation**: If corrected protocol still shows usability/pricing/competitive issues, this indicates core business model problems, not execution flaws.
