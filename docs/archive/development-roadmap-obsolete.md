**Deliverable**: AI suggests relevant templates and helps structure decisions

### Sprint 3: Collaboration Features (Nov 5-19)
**Multi-User Workflows:**
- Real-time collaborative scoring
- Comment and discussion threads
- Decision status tracking and notifications
- Team member role management

**Deliverable**: Teams can collaboratively evaluate decisions

### Sprint 4: Progress Tracking (Nov 19 - Dec 3) 
**Outcome Management:**
- Decision implementation tracking
- Outcome recording and analysis
- Historical decision review
- Basic reporting and insights

**Deliverable**: Users can track decision effectiveness over time

## Phase 3: Market Validation (Sprint 5-6, Weeks 16-21)

### Sprint 5: Beta Launch Preparation (Dec 3-17)
**Polish and Stability:**
- UI/UX refinement based on customer feedback
- Performance optimization
- Security audit and hardening
- Comprehensive testing suite

**Deliverable**: Production-ready beta version

### Sprint 6: Beta Launch (Dec 17-31)
**Go-to-Market Execution:**
- Beta customer onboarding
- Usage analytics and feedback collection  
- Rapid iteration based on user behavior
- Pricing and billing system implementation

**Deliverable**: 25+ active beta customers providing feedback

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current State (Sprint 0)
```
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript
Backend: Next.js API routes + Prisma
Database: PostgreSQL (PlanetScale free tier)
AI: DeepSeek R1 local + API fallbacks
Deployment: Local development
```

### Target State (Sprint 6)
```
Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind + TypeScript (optimized)
Backend: Next.js API routes + Prisma + background jobs
Database: PostgreSQL (PlanetScale Pro if needed)
AI: DeepSeek R1 local + optimized prompt engineering
Deployment: Vercel + PlanetScale + monitoring
Integrations: Slack webhooks, email notifications
```

## Development Standards and Practices

### Code Quality Requirements
- TypeScript strict mode enforced
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Unit tests for business logic (Jest)
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows (Playwright)

### Performance Targets
- Page load times <3 seconds
- AI response times <5 seconds (local), <8 seconds (API)
- Database query optimization (<100ms common queries)
- 95%+ uptime during beta phase

### Security Implementation
- OWASP security checklist compliance
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- XSS protection and input validation
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Technical Risks
**AI Performance Issues:**
- Mitigation: API fallback system, prompt optimization
- Monitoring: Response time tracking, error rate alerts

**Database Scaling:**
- Mitigation: Query optimization, read replicas planning
- Monitoring: Query performance metrics, connection pooling

**Development Velocity:**
- Mitigation: Clear sprint goals, technical debt management
- Monitoring: Story point velocity, cycle time tracking

### Resource Constraints
**Solo Developer Capacity:**
- Focus on core features first, defer nice-to-have items
- Use proven libraries and patterns to reduce implementation time
- Prioritize features based on customer interview feedback

**Budget Management:**
- Monitor service costs weekly
- Plan upgrade paths for scaling services
- Optimize for free tier usage during MVP phase

**Timeline Pressure:**
- Build buffer time into sprint planning (20% contingency)
- Prioritize ruthlessly based on customer validation
- Plan technical debt reduction sprints

This roadmap provides clear milestones while maintaining flexibility for customer feedback integration and rapid iteration.
