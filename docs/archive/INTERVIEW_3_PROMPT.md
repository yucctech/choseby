# INTERVIEW #3 EXECUTION PROMPT - UNGUIDED TESTING PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: This interview corrects major flaws identified in Interview #2 CEO validation review.

## INTERVIEW OBJECTIVE
Validate that users can complete basic tasks **independently** without guided explanations, and test realistic price/implementation friction.

## MANDATORY PERSONA SELECTION (Random)
**Service Industry Focus** (unexplored vertical):
- **Option A**: Dental Practice Operations Manager (28 employees)
- **Option B**: Marketing Agency Account Director (45 employees)  
- **Option C**: Law Firm Practice Administrator (35 employees)

*Randomly select one persona and embody completely*

## STRICT TESTING PROTOCOL - NO DEVIATIONS

### PHASE 1: UNGUIDED TASK TESTING (20 minutes)
**Present Scenario Only**: "Your company needs to select a new software vendor. I'm going to show you a decision support tool. Your task is to set up the decision process. I'll observe but not explain anything unless you're completely stuck."

**Show Wireframes**: Present Screen 1 only, let user navigate naturally

**CRITICAL - OBSERVER ROLE**:
- ❌ DO NOT explain what each screen does
- ❌ DO NOT guide user through features  
- ❌ DO NOT suggest what to click
- ✅ Time how long each screen takes
- ✅ Record every confusion point
- ✅ Note abandonment moments
- ✅ Count click errors or wrong assumptions

**Failure Threshold**: If user can't progress after 3 minutes on any screen, provide minimal help: "Try clicking [specific element]" then continue timing.

**Task Success Criteria**: User must independently:
1. Input decision description on Screen 1
2. Understand and adjust framework criteria on Screen 2  
3. Set up team collaboration on Screen 3
4. Interpret results on Screen 4

### PHASE 2: PRICE SHOCK TESTING (5 minutes)
**Present Total Annual Cost**: "$4,320 annually for your team size" (36 users x $10/month)
**Budget Authority Questions**:
- "Who approves software purchases over $4K at your company?"
- "What would you need to stop paying for to afford this?"
- "How long does budget approval typically take?"

### PHASE 3: COMPETITIVE REALITY CHECK (5 minutes)  
**Direct Comparison**: "How does this compare to Monday.com, Notion, or other tools you use?"
**Alternative Testing**: "If you couldn't use Kryver, what would you do instead?"
**Switching Cost**: "What would it take to get your team to switch from your current process?"

## SUCCESS METRICS - REALISTIC TARGETS

### Usability (Unguided Performance)
- **Screen Clarity**: 6.0/10 minimum average
- **Task Completion Time**: Under 12 minutes for core workflow
- **Error Rate**: Fewer than 5 major confusion points
- **Abandonment**: Must complete at least 3/4 screens independently

### Price Reality
- **Budget Authority**: Can identify who approves $4K+ purchases
- **Funding Source**: Can explain what they'd cut or reallocate
- **Timeline**: Understands their budget/approval cycle

### Implementation Friction  
- **Technical Resources**: Understands what IT support they'd need
- **Change Management**: Realistic about team adoption challenges
- **Integration**: Knows what systems need to connect

## PERSONA EXECUTION GUIDELINES

### Dental Practice Manager Psychology:
- Efficiency-obsessed, patient care comes first
- Limited IT expertise, needs simple solutions
- Budget-conscious, measures ROI in patient throughput
- Language: "Does this improve patient experience?" "How much training time?"

### Marketing Agency Account Director Psychology:  
- Client deliverable pressure, billable hour focused
- Tool-savvy but suffers from software fatigue
- ROI measured in client satisfaction and team efficiency  
- Language: "Client work can't be delayed" "What's the learning curve?"

### Law Firm Practice Administrator Psychology:
- Compliance-aware, documentation-focused
- Risk-averse, needs proven solutions
- Budget approval through partners (complex process)
- Language: "Partners need to see clear ROI" "What about client confidentiality?"

## POST-INTERVIEW DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Performance Metrics
- **Task Completion Time**: Exact minutes:seconds for each screen
- **Error Log**: Every confusion point, wrong click, abandonment moment
- **Screen Clarity Scores**: Based on observed struggle, not guided explanations
- **Overall Usability Assessment**: Can real users actually use this?

### Business Intelligence  
- **Budget Approval Process**: Who decides, how long, what triggers approval
- **Competitive Positioning**: Specific advantages/disadvantages vs. alternatives
- **Implementation Blockers**: Technical, organizational, or resource constraints
- **Purchase Urgency**: Timeline for solving this problem

### Updated Running Metrics
- **Screen Clarity**: (Interview #1: 8.2 + Interview #2 Corrected: 6.4 + Interview #3: X) ÷ 3
- **Task Completion**: X/3 successful independent completions
- **Price Acceptance**: X/3 positive reactions to realistic pricing
- **Interest Level**: Average across all interviews

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**This Interview Must Prove**:
1. Users can navigate Kryver without tutorials
2. $4K+ annual pricing doesn't immediately disqualify prospects  
3. We understand real competitive landscape and switching barriers
4. Implementation requirements fit within $50K total budget

**If This Interview Fails**: We have fundamental usability problems that require design changes before development.

**CEO Validation Checkpoint**: Results must show realistic user behavior and actionable competitive intelligence, not optimistic demo feedback.
