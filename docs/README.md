# KRYVER AI DECISION PLATFORM - PROJECT HANDOVER

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**Product**: AI Decision Platform for SMB decision support
**Status**: Customer concept validation phase  
**Budget**: Flexible based on validation ($15K-50K depending on scope)
**Timeline**: 4-week concept validation, then development based on results
**Current Focus**: Test AI platform concepts vs simple template approaches

---

## CORE PRODUCT DIRECTION

### AI Decision Platform (Primary Focus)
**Vision**: AI-powered platform that helps SMBs make better decisions faster
**Value Proposition**: Premium decision support platform commanding higher revenue per customer
**Technology**: DeepSeek R1 local AI processing + React/Node.js platform
**Target Revenue**: $21.50/user/month (vs commodity template pricing)

### Customer Scenarios:
1. **Simple Decisions**: Customer knows what they want, needs speed → Simple template approach may suffice
2. **Complex Decisions**: Unclear process, unfamiliar territory → AI assistance provides significant value

### Market Positioning
- **vs Consultants**: Faster, cheaper, always available decision support  
- **vs Templates**: AI-powered customization vs one-size-fits-all
- **vs Productivity Tools**: Decision intelligence vs task management

## CURRENT VALIDATION PHASE

### Three AI Platform Concepts to Test
**Objective**: Determine optimal AI integration level before development investment

#### 1. Akinator-Style "Decision Interview"
- **Approach**: AI asks questions to understand decision, builds custom framework
- **Target**: Complex decisions where customers don't know how to structure evaluation
- **Example**: "Expanding to new market" → AI guides through strategic framework creation

#### 2. Smart Framework Builder  
- **Approach**: Customer describes decision, AI creates relevant template
- **Target**: Standard decisions (vendor selection, hiring) with AI enhancement
- **Example**: "Healthcare scheduling vendor" → AI generates healthcare-specific criteria

#### 3. Simple Templates (Interview #9 Baseline)
- **Approach**: Pre-built templates, minimal AI required
- **Target**: Operations teams wanting speed over customization  
- **Example**: Standard vendor comparison spreadsheet

### Validation Success Metrics
- **Customer Preference**: Which concept resonates with high-value prospects
- **Pricing Acceptance**: Can chosen concept justify $21.50/user/month pricing
- **Market Fit**: Clear customer segment willing to pay premium for AI assistance

### Budget Strategy
- **Concept Testing**: Minimal investment for validation
- **Development Budget**: $15K-50K depending on chosen concept complexity
- **Revenue Target**: Higher revenue per customer vs volume-based model

## CURRENT STATUS: WIREFRAME DEVELOPMENT READY

### ✅ COMPLETED PHASES
1. **Customer Validation**: Interview #9 healthcare feedback analyzed
2. **Product Pivot**: Simple templates approach validated
3. **User Flow Design**: Complete 6-screen workflow specification
4. **Business Requirements**: Consolidated into essential-business-data.md

### 🎯 CURRENT PHASE: Wireframe Development
**Target Scenario**: Healthcare clinic selecting scheduling software
**Key Stakeholders**: Operations Manager (primary), IT person, front desk supervisor, practice administrator
**Timeline**: Complete decision in 2-3 weeks vs current 2-3 months

### 📋 DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS
- **Complete User Flow**: [stakeholder-collaboration-user-flow.md](stakeholder-collaboration-user-flow.md)
- **Customer Requirements**: [essential-business-data.md](essential-business-data.md)
- **Session Context**: [SESSION_CONTEXT.md](SESSION_CONTEXT.md)

## WIREFRAME REQUIREMENTS

### PRIMARY USER FLOW: Vendor/Solution Selection
1. **Decision Setup** - Simple initialization without stakeholder weighting
2. **Individual Assessment** - Role-based private evaluation to eliminate groupthink
3. **Vendor Evaluation** - Structured comparison template with healthcare-specific criteria
4. **Conflict Detection** - Automated identification of stakeholder disagreements
5. **Collaborative Resolution** - Structured discussion facilitation without politics
6. **Executive Summary** - Auto-generated 2-paragraph recommendation format

### CRITICAL SUCCESS METRICS
- **Completion Time**: <30 minutes per vendor evaluation
- **Value Recognition**: Immediate improvement over spreadsheet chaos
- **Political Neutrality**: No features creating interpersonal hierarchy
- **Output Format**: Exactly matches customer-requested executive summary style

---

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Technology Stack (BUDGET-CONSCIOUS)
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js (standard web app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with simple database
- **AI Requirements**: NONE (major cost savings vs original DeepSeek integration)
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify free tiers initially
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on free tier

### Development Budget: $15K Maximum
- **Savings vs Original**: $20K (no complex AI framework integration)
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months vs 8-10 months original

---

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### Wireframe Testing Protocol (Week 3-4)
Must test with **3 customers minimum**:
1. **Healthcare**: Different clinic than Interview #9
2. **Professional Services**: Accounting or legal firm
3. **Alternative Industry**: Manufacturing or financial services

### Success Criteria for Each Test
✅ **Usability**: Can complete vendor comparison in <30 minutes  
✅ **Value Recognition**: Prefers this approach over current process  
✅ **Pricing Acceptance**: Confirms $3,600 annual worth it  
✅ **Output Satisfaction**: Executive summary format meets needs  

### Failure Indicators (Require Further Pivot)
❌ **Still too complex**: More than 30 minutes to complete  
❌ **Prefers status quo**: Doesn't see enough improvement  
❌ **Pricing resistance**: Questions value at $3,600  
❌ **Format rejection**: Output doesn't meet executive needs

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (CRITICAL)

### 1. SIMPLICITY OVER SOPHISTICATION
- **Rule**: If it requires explanation, it's too complex
- **Test**: Could a busy operations manager use this during lunch break?

### 2. ENHANCEMENT OVER REPLACEMENT
- **Rule**: Augment current workflows, don't force new methodologies
- **Test**: Does this feel like natural evolution of spreadsheet comparison?

### 3. POLITICAL NEUTRALITY
- **Rule**: No features that create interpersonal hierarchy or conflict
- **Test**: Would team members feel comfortable using this together?

### 4. IMMEDIATE VALUE
- **Rule**: Value visible within first 10 minutes of use
- **Test**: Can user see clear improvement over current process immediately?

## NEXT STEPS

### Week 1-2: Wireframe Development
- Create interactive wireframes for 6 core screens
- Focus on healthcare vendor selection workflow
### Week 3-4: Customer Validation  
- Test AI platform concepts with high-value customers
- Validate which approach justifies premium pricing
- Document feedback and determine development scope

### Next Phase: Development Based on Validation
- Build chosen concept (simple templates OR AI platform)
- Technology stack and budget scale with customer preference
- Target first paying customers based on validated pricing model
