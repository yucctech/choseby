# INTERVIEW #6 EXECUTION PROMPT - PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COMPLETION
**CONTEXT**: Interviews #4 (accounting) and #5 (legal) successfully validated professional services market with remarkable consistency. Interview #6 must test consulting vertical to complete 3-vertical validation before customer acquisition phase.

## PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY
**Kryver**: SMB decision support platform, $50K budget, 18-month runway  
**Validated Model**: $2,400 annual pricing with complementary positioning to productivity tools  
**Target Market**: Professional services firms (35-50 employees) with compliance/billable hour focus  
**Success Metric**: $1K MRR by month 6 (5 customers × $200 MRR each)

## INTERVIEW #4 + #5 CRITICAL VALIDATION SUCCESSES TO BUILD ON

### Pricing Consistency Breakthrough
- **Interview #4 (Accounting)**: "$4.40/month per person... more reasonable than I expected"
- **Interview #5 (Legal)**: "$5.70/month per person... more reasonable than I expected"  
- **Pattern**: Immediate cost-per-person calculation with positive reaction

### Competitive Positioning Success
- **Interview #4**: "complement Google Workspace rather than replace it"
- **Interview #5**: "complement Microsoft 365 rather than replace it"
- **Pattern**: Decision support seen as distinct market category from productivity tools

### Professional Services Market Validation  
- **Authority Structure**: Partner/Managing Partner approval, 2-3 week cycles
- **Value Drivers**: Compliance requirements + billable time savings
- **Decision Volume**: 6-10 major operational decisions annually
- **Implementation**: Clear ROI through professional time efficiency

## INTERVIEW #6 OBJECTIVE
**Complete professional services validation** by testing Management Consulting Operations Manager (40 employees) using the proven Interview #4/#5 methodology to confirm 3-vertical consistency.

## MANDATORY PERSONA (Consulting Industry Variation)
**Management Consulting Operations Manager (40 employees)**:
- **Language**: "Client deliverables", "engagement profitability", "partner utilization"
- **Budget Reality**: "Partners track every overhead expense", "Need documented ROI for ops investments"  
- **Decision Examples**: Office relocations, new service offerings, technology implementations
- **Billable Focus**: "Non-billable admin time impacts engagement profitability"

## STRICT PROTOCOL - ZERO DEVIATIONS (Proven from Interview #4 + #5)

### PHASE 1: UNGUIDED TASK TESTING (12 minutes max)
**Present Scenario**: "Your consulting firm needs to evaluate an important decision - new office location, expanding service capabilities, or major technology selection. Set up the decision process using this tool. I'll only help if you're stuck for 3 full minutes."

**Success Criteria**: 
- **<12 minutes completion** (Interview #4: 7:00, Interview #5: 6:30)
- **<3 confusion points** (Interview #4: 0, Interview #5: 0)  
- **No intervention needed** (both interviews achieved zero help)

### PHASE 2: PRICING VALIDATION (8 minutes)
**Present**: "$2,400 annually for your 40-person team"
**Probe**: "What would you cut from current budget?" "Who approves $2,400 purchases?" "How long for approval?"

**Success Criteria**:
- **Neutral/positive reaction** (both previous interviews: "more reasonable than expected")
- **Funding source identified** (Interview #4: failed tools, Interview #5: redundant subscriptions)
- **Cost-per-person calculation** ($5-6/month range expected based on pattern)

### PHASE 3: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (7 minutes)  
**Test vs**: Current productivity tools (expect Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace)
**Validate**: Complementary positioning, willingness to pay additional cost
**Success Criteria**: 
- **Clear value differentiation** (decision support vs productivity tools)
- **Integration expectation** (complement existing stack, not replace)

## SUCCESS VALIDATION TARGETS

### Consistency Metrics (Must Match Interview #4 + #5)
- **Usability**: Task completion under 12 minutes without guidance
- **Pricing**: Positive reaction to $2,400 annual with cost-per-person calculation  
- **Market Fit**: Consulting-specific compliance/billable value drivers
- **Positioning**: Complementary strategy vs productivity tool replacement

### Consulting-Specific Validation Requirements
- **Engagement Economics**: ROI justification through billable hour efficiency
- **Client Deliverable Quality**: Decision frameworks improve client outcomes
- **Partner Utilization**: Structured processes reduce partner administrative burden
- **Consulting Methodology**: Framework approach aligns with consulting best practices
