# Design Validation Interview Process
## Refocused on UX Testing & Wireframe Validation

**Created**: September 4, 2025  
**Purpose**: Validate existing wireframes through customer testing
**Context**: Post-market research pivot back to original design validation goal

---

## Core Objective: DESIGN VALIDATION THROUGH USER TESTING

### Primary Goals

2. **Validate user flows** for decision documentation workflows  
3. **Assess screen clarity** and usability (target: 80%+ clarity scores)
4. **Confirm value proposition communication** through design (target: 75%+ recognition)
5. **Price acceptance validation** within $5-20/user range (target: 60%+ acceptance)

### Success Criteria (Quantitative)
- **15+ completed interviews** with qualified SMB decision-makers (25-99 employees)
- **80%+ screen clarity scores** across all major wireframes
- **75%+ value proposition recognition** from design review
- **60%+ price acceptance** in target range
- **Clear go/no-go recommendation** for current design vs iteration needs

## Design-First Interview Structure (30 minutes)

### Phase 1: Context Setting (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish participant profile and current decision-making context

**Key Questions**:
- "What's your role and team size?" (Qualify: 25-99 employees)
- "How do you currently document important business decisions?"  
- "What tools do you use for project management or collaboration?"

**Output**: Persona classification and current state baseline

### Phase 2: Wireframe Walkthrough & Testing (15 minutes) - **CORE FOCUS**
**Objective**: Test actual design usability and comprehension

#### Screen-by-Screen Validation Method:
**Screen 1 - Dashboard**: 
- "Looking at this screen, what do you think this application does?"
- "Where would you click first to start a new decision?"
- **Clarity Score**: 1-10 rating + explanation

**Screen 2 - Decision Creation**:
- "Walk me through how you'd document a vendor selection decision here"
- "What information is this screen asking for?"
- **Task Completion**: Can they identify next steps?

**Screen 3 - Framework Selection**:
- "What do you think these templates are for?"
- "Which would you choose for a hiring decision?"
- **Value Recognition**: Do they understand the framework concept?

**Screen 4 - Collaboration**:
- "How would you involve your team in this decision?"
- "What happens when you click 'Share for Review'?"
- **Workflow Clarity**: Can they predict the collaboration flow?

**Screen 5 - Audit Trail**:
- "If an auditor asked about this decision, what would you show them?"
- "How complete does this documentation look?"
- **Compliance Value**: Do they see audit/compliance benefits?

#### Real-Time Testing Protocol:
- **Show wireframes via screen share**
- **Ask for immediate reactions** (first 10 seconds)  
- **Task-based questions** for each screen
- **Record hesitations, confusion points, suggestions**
- **Rate clarity 1-10 for each screen**

### Phase 3: Value Proposition & Pricing Validation (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Confirm design communicates value and test price sensitivity

**Value Testing**:
- "Based on what you've seen, how would you describe this product to a colleague?"
- "What's the main benefit this would provide your team?"
- "How is this different from Monday.com/Notion/your current tools?"

**Pricing Reality Check**:
- "For your team of X people, this would cost $X/month. How does that sound?"
- "What would justify that price point for you?"
- "What's your current budget for productivity tools?"

### Phase 4: Go/No-Go Input & Follow-up (5 minutes)
**Objective**: Determine design readiness and gather improvement priorities

**Design Iteration Questions**:
- "What was most confusing about the interface?"
- "What would you change to make this easier to use?"  
- "Would you be interested in testing an early version?"

**Implementation Readiness**:
- "If this launched next month, would your team try it?"
- "What would prevent you from using this?"
