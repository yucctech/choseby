## Core Pain Points Identification

### Decision Coordination Chaos

**The "How Should We Respond?" Email Thread Problem**:
- **Situation**: Complex customer issue requiring multiple stakeholder input
- **Current Process**: 47+ Slack messages → 2+ meetings → 3-5 day response delay

### Inconsistent Response Quality

**Same Situation, Different Responses Problem**:
- **Situation**: Similar customer scenarios handled differently by different team members
- **Examples**: 
  - Refund requests: 73% approval variation for similar circumstances
  - Policy exceptions: 45% inconsistency in interpretation application
  - Escalation decisions: 60% variance in escalation trigger criteria
- **Root Causes**: No decision framework, unclear authority, missing precedent tracking

### Context Loss and Repeated Decisions

**The "Didn't We Decide This Before?" Problem**:

- **Current Process**: Decision rationale disappears after email/Slack resolution
- **Examples**:
  - Monthly re-debates about refund policy interpretation
  - Quarterly discussions about enterprise customer escalation procedures
  - Seasonal confusion about holiday policy modifications

**Quantified Impact**:
- **Repeated Coordination**: 30% of decisions are substantially similar to previous decisions
- **Time Waste**: 8-12 hours monthly per team on previously-resolved decision types
- **Knowledge Loss**: 78% of decision rationale inaccessible after 90 days
- **Onboarding Burden**: 20+ hours training new team members on informal decision precedents

## Stakeholder Coordination Challenges

### Multi-Stakeholder Input Collection

**The "Getting Everyone's Opinion" Challenge**:
- **Process Breakdown**: Serial consultation vs parallel input collection inefficiency
- **Authority Confusion**: Unclear decision-making authority and final approval process
- **Input Quality**: Rushed stakeholder input vs thorough consideration balance
