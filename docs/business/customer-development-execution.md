# Customer Development Execution Strategy

## Immediate Customer Interview Plan (Sprint 0)

### Target Personas for Initial Interviews
**Primary Target: SMB Decision Makers (25-99 employees)**
- Operations managers at growing companies
- Founders/CEOs of established SMBs  
- Department heads responsible for process improvement
- Consultants who help SMBs with decision-making

**Secondary Target: Adjacent Users**
- Freelance consultants and coaches
- Project managers at mid-size companies
- Team leads in remote/hybrid organizations

## Interview Execution Framework

### Week 1 Outreach Strategy (5 Interviews Target)
**LinkedIn Outreach (Primary Channel):**
- Search: "Operations Manager" + "50-200 employees" + local region
- Message template: Brief intro + decision-making research + 20-minute call
- Target response rate: 10-15% (send 40-50 messages to get 5 interviews)

**Cold Email Outreach (Secondary Channel):**  
- SMB databases and directories
- Local business associations and chambers of commerce
- Industry-specific groups (professional services, healthcare SMBs)

**Warm Network Activation:**
- Personal/professional connections who fit target profile
- Ask for introductions to relevant SMB decision makers
- Alumni networks and professional associations

### Interview Script and Process

**Pre-Interview Setup (5 minutes):**
- Confirm recording consent
- Explain research purpose (building decision support tools for SMBs)
- Set 20-minute time expectation

**Opening Questions (5 minutes):**
- Role, company size, industry
- "Walk me through a recent difficult business decision your team made"
- "What made that decision challenging?"

**Pain Point Discovery (10 minutes):**
- "How does your team typically approach important decisions?"
- "What tools or processes do you currently use?"
- "What's frustrating about your current approach?"
- "Tell me about a decision that didn't go well - what happened?"

**Solution Validation (3 minutes):**
- Present framework-first approach concept
- "Would pre-built decision templates be more valuable than AI-generated recommendations?"
- "What would make you consider paying for better decision-making tools?"

**Wrap-up (2 minutes):**
- Budget range discussion
- Follow-up consent for prototype testing
- Referral requests
