# Cross-Domain Dependencies

## Active Dependencies (Blocking Relationships)

### Business → Technical Dependencies
**Market Validation → Feature Prioritization**:
- Customer interview insights determine MVP feature priorities
- Decision type frequency affects template development order
- Pricing feedback influences technical complexity decisions
- **Status**: Customer interviews starting Week 1

**Customer Feedback → AI Feature Requirements**:
- User preference for framework templates vs AI predictions
- Complexity tolerance affects AI integration approach
- **Status**: Validation needed through customer development

### Technical → Business Dependencies  
**AI Cost Validation → Pricing Model**:
- DeepSeek R1 performance affects operational cost assumptions
- API fallback usage impacts unit economics projections
- **Status**: Local AI setup required for validation

**Development Velocity → Timeline Commitments**:
- Solo founder development capacity affects customer promises
- Technical complexity affects go-to-market timing
- **Status**: Development environment setup in progress

### Operations → All Domains Dependencies
**Budget Constraints → Scope Decisions**:
- $50K total budget limits technical sophistication
- Monthly burn rate affects timeline and hiring decisions
- **Status**: Budget tracking system needed

**Timeline Pressure → Quality Trade-offs**:
- 6-month revenue target affects MVP scope
- Market competition affects feature development speed
- **Status**: Milestone tracking required

## Cross-Domain Communication Protocols

### Weekly Alignment Points
**Business-Technical Alignment**:
- Customer feedback review impacts technical priorities
- Technical feasibility feedback affects business promises
- **Schedule**: Weekly review meetings

**Technical-Operations Alignment**:  
- Development progress affects timeline projections
- Resource needs affect budget planning
- **Schedule**: Weekly sprint planning

### Decision Escalation Process
**Cross-Domain Conflicts**:
1. Identify conflicting priorities between domains
2. Document trade-offs and implications  
3. Make founder decision with rationale
4. Update affected domain documentation
5. Communicate decision to all stakeholders

## Dependency Monitoring

### High-Risk Dependencies
- Customer validation results affecting entire business model
- Local AI performance affecting cost assumptions
- Solo founder capacity affecting all execution timelines

### Mitigation Strategies
- Parallel validation approaches to reduce customer research risk
- API fallback strategy for AI implementation risk
- Clear priority frameworks for capacity management
