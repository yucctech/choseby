# Next Session Requirements - API Documentation & Wireframes

## Session Context Setup

**Previous Session Accomplishments âœ…**:
- User Flow Diagrams completed and validated by all expert perspectives
- Core DECIDE workflow supports 3 modes: Full 6-phase, Express 3-phase, Emergency bypass
- All customer pain points addressed and adoption barriers removed
- Expert validation confirms readiness for API documentation and wireframes

## Priority Task Order for Next Session

### 1. API Documentation (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Why First**: API contracts determine data structure for wireframes
**Location**: `docs/technical/api-specifications/`
**Requirements**: 
- Based on validated user flows in `docs/technical/user-flows/`
- OpenAPI/Swagger format for formal specification
- Support for 3 workflow types: Emergency, Express, Full DECIDE
- Healthcare compliance and HIPAA requirements
- DeepSeek R1 AI integration endpoints
- Real-time WebSocket events for team collaboration

### 2. Wireframe Development (SECOND PRIORITY)
**Why Second**: Wireframes implement user flows and consume API data
**Location**: `docs/technical/wireframes/`
**Requirements**:
- 23 screens minimum (see design-system-approved.md for complete list)
- Support validated user flows (Emergency/Express/Full workflows)
- Mobile-first design for healthcare tablet usage
- Anonymous evaluation interfaces
- Conflict detection and resolution screens
- Professional documentation generation

## Critical Context Files for Next Session

### User Flow Foundation (COMPLETED)
- `docs/technical/user-flows/core-decide-workflow.md` - Complete 6-phase workflow
- `docs/technical/user-flows/expert-revalidation-improved-workflow.md` - All expert approvals

### Technical Specifications  
- `docs/technical/COMPLETE_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md` - Implementation rules
- `docs/technical/database-schema.md` - Data structure requirements
- `docs/technical/development-handoff-specs.md` - Development requirements

### Business Requirements
- `docs/business/customer-development.md` - Customer validation and pilot requirements
- `docs/business/customer-interviews/patterns-dashboard.md` - Customer pain points

### Current Status
- `docs/current/ACTIVE_TASKS.md` - Updated with user flow completion
- `docs/technical/design-system-approved.md` - 23 wireframe requirements

## Key Decisions Made in Previous Session

1. **Three Workflow Types**: Emergency bypass, Express 3-phase, Full 6-phase DECIDE
2. **Participation Enforcement**: Escalation ladder with manager involvement  
3. **Decision Override Protection**: Mandatory justification + approval
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Step-by-step evaluation for touch interfaces
5. **Healthcare Compliance**: Regulatory calendar integration + audit trails

## Session Success Criteria

### API Documentation Complete When:
- OpenAPI specification covers all user flow endpoints
- Emergency, Express, and Full workflow APIs defined
- Healthcare compliance endpoints specified
- DeepSeek R1 AI integration contracts documented
- Real-time collaboration events defined

### Wireframe Development Complete When:
- All 23 screens designed and documented
- Emergency/Express/Full workflow screens support user flows
- Mobile responsive layouts defined
- Anonymous evaluation interfaces specified
- Professional documentation generation screens designed

## Expert Roles for Validation

- **Technical Lead**: API endpoint validation and data flow verification
- **UX Designer**: Wireframe usability and mobile optimization validation  
- **Product Manager**: Business logic and customer requirement validation
- **Healthcare Expert**: Compliance and workflow validation

**Status**: Ready for next session focused on API documentation and wireframes
