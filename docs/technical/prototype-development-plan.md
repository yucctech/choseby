### Phase 1 MVP: Core Team Decision Workflow (Weeks 1-8)

#### Essential User Flow
1. **Team Setup**: Create decision, invite team members with role assignments (CEO, CTO, Operations, etc.)
2. **Anonymous Scoring**: Each member evaluates privately based on their expertise area
3. **Conflict Detection**: System identifies exactly where team members disagree and why
4. **Facilitated Resolution**: Structured discussion workflow to resolve conflicts systematically
5. **Decision Documentation**: Generate professional rationale suitable for board presentations
6. **Implementation Tracking**: Monitor decision outcomes and team learning

#### Industry-Specific Customization
- **Professional Services**: Partnership decisions, client strategy, business development evaluation criteria
- **Healthcare**: Clinical/administrative coordination, compliance requirements, patient care impact assessment
- **Manufacturing**: Technical disciplines integration, safety/quality requirements, operational constraints
- **Tech Scale-ups**: Executive strategic alignment, board presentation requirements, growth coordination

#### Key Features (MVP)
- **Team Creation & Invitations**: Multi-user authentication with role-based permissions
- **Anonymous Input Collection**: Private evaluation forms eliminating groupthink and political pressure
- **Conflict Visualization**: Clear display of where team disagrees with rationale
- **Discussion Facilitation**: Structured workflow guides toward resolution vs endless debate
- **Professional Export**: Board-ready decision documentation with audit trails
- **Customization Tools**: Add/remove criteria, adjust weighting, reorder priorities
- **Export Options**: PDF template, spreadsheet format, summary view

#### Testing Integration
- **Usage Analytics**: Track completion rates, time spent, feature usage
- **Feedback Collection**: Post-demo survey about value and pricing
- **Real Decision Testing**: Encourage users to apply template to actual pending decision

## CLAUDE CODE IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

### Development Phase 1: Smart Framework Builder (Week 1-2)

**Build a single-page React application with the following components:**

1. **Decision Input Component**
   - Text area for decision description
   - Industry selector dropdown
   - Decision type selector (vendor, hiring, strategic, etc.)

2. **Context Questions Component**  
   - Dynamic questions based on selection
   - 2-3 follow-up questions maximum
   - Simple form validation

3. **Template Generation Component**
   - Display generated evaluation criteria
   - Show customized template based on inputs
   - Simulate "AI thinking" with loading states

4. **Template Customization Component**
   - Edit criteria list
   - Adjust weighting/importance
   - Add custom criteria
   - Reorder items

5. **Export Component**
   - PDF generation
   - Spreadsheet download
   - Email template option

### Pre-Written AI Response Database

**Create JSON files with simulated AI responses for:**
- **Healthcare + Vendor Selection**: Criteria like HIPAA compliance, EHR integration, staff training
- **Professional Services + Hiring**: Criteria like client experience, technical skills, cultural fit
- **Manufacturing + Investment**: Criteria like ROI analysis, safety requirements, scalability

### Analytics Integration
- **Usage Tracking**: Page views, completion rates, time on each step
- **Feature Usage**: Which customization features get used most
- **Export Tracking**: How many people actually download/export templates

### Testing Framework
- **Demo Mode**: Pre-populate with sample decisions for easy testing
- **Real Mode**: Users input their actual pending decisions
- **Feedback Collection**: Post-demo survey with pricing questions

## VALIDATION TESTING PROTOCOL

### Week 3: Real Decision Testing
**Target**: 5 pending decisions from existing network
**Process**: Send prototype link with specific decision to evaluate
**Data Collection**: Usage analytics + follow-up conversation

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Healthcare Clinic**: Scheduling software selection
2. **Accounting Firm**: Cloud accounting platform evaluation  
3. **Manufacturing**: Equipment vendor selection
4. **Tech Startup**: Marketing agency hiring
5. **Professional Services**: Office space lease decision

### Success Metrics
- **>80% Completion Rate**: Users finish the entire template creation process
- **>15 Minutes Time Investment**: Indicates serious engagement with tool
- **>50% Export Rate**: Users download/save the generated template
- **Pricing Acceptance**: Positive response to $21.50/user pricing question

### Follow-up Validation Questions
1. "Did you use this template for your actual decision?"
2. "How does this compare to your current decision process?"
3. "What would you pay for this tool monthly?"
4. "Would you recommend this to colleagues?"

## DEVELOPMENT SUCCESS CRITERIA

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- ✅ Smart Framework Builder prototype fully functional
- ✅ 3+ industry templates with realistic criteria
- ✅ Export functionality working (PDF + spreadsheet)
- ✅ Usage analytics tracking implemented
- ✅ Feedback collection system in place

### Go/No-Go Decision Point
**After Week 3 Testing Results**:
- **Strong Validation**: Build Phase 2 (Akinator prototype) + plan full development
- **Moderate Validation**: Iterate on Smart Builder based on feedback
- **Weak Validation**: Pivot to Simple Templates or reconsider market

## CLAUDE CODE HANDOFF PACKAGE

### Files to Reference
- `docs/essential-business-data.md` - Customer requirements and target pricing
- `docs/operations/current-status.md` - Current phase and strategic context  
- `docs/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - Project guidelines and constraints

### Development Scope
**Build**: Single-page React prototype for Smart Framework Builder concept
**Timeline**: 2 weeks maximum for functional demo
**Focus**: User experience flow and validation testing, not production quality

### Next Phase Trigger
**If prototype validation succeeds**: Full platform development with validated concept
**If prototype validation fails**: Quick pivot to alternative approach or market

---

**CRITICAL**: This prototype is for market validation only. Focus on speed to testing over production quality. The goal is behavioral data on customer willingness to use and pay for this approach.
