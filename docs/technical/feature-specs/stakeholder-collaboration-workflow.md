# Stakeholder Collaboration Workflow - Feature Specification

**Customer Validation**: Healthcare Operations Manager Interview #9 - Primary pain point identified
**Business Context**: 4-stakeholder vendor selection (Operations, IT, Front Desk, Admin) without political weighting
**Key Requirement**: *"Template that helps organize vendor comparisons consistently"* + eliminate circular discussions

## **Core Design Principles**

### **Political Neutrality Architecture**
- **Private Assessment Phase**: No stakeholder sees others' input until completion
- **System-Facilitated Conflicts**: Highlight differences as information, not judgment
- **Human Final Authority**: Operations Manager facilitates, system doesn't override
- **Expertise-Based Interface**: Each stakeholder sees domain-relevant sections highlighted

### **Workflow Architecture**

## **Phase 1: Individual Input (Private Assessment)**

### **Role-Specific Dashboard Design**

#### **Operations Manager Interface**

#### **Consensus Areas Display**
```
ASSESSMENT SUMMARY - VENDOR A vs VENDOR B vs VENDOR C

CONSENSUS AREAS ✓
├─ HIPAA Compliance: All agree "Certified" for Vendor A & B
├─ Cost Range: All comfortable with Vendor A pricing
└─ Implementation: All prefer 6-week timeline

STRONG CONVERGENCE ↗
├─ Vendor C: All stakeholders rated below 6/10
└─ → Auto-suggest: "Consider eliminating Vendor C from evaluation"
```

#### **Discussion-Needed Areas**
```
DISCUSSION NEEDED ⚠️

├─ Ease of Use - Vendor A:
│   ├─ Lisa (Front Desk): "Very Easy" - "Looks just like our current system"
│   ├─ Janet (IT): "Moderate" - "Simple UI but limited admin controls"  
│   ├─ Operations: "Good" - "Balance between simplicity and features"
│   └─ → RESOLUTION ACTIONS:
│       □ Schedule vendor demo focused on admin features
│       □ Request admin interface walkthrough 
│       □ Test both user and admin interfaces
│
├─ EMR Integration - Vendor B:
│   ├─ Janet (IT): "Direct API" - "Clean HL7 FHIR integration"
│   ├─ Operations: "Partial" - "Vendor said 'mostly compatible'"
│   ├─ Mark (Admin): "Unknown" - "Need cost estimate for integration"
│   └─ → RESOLUTION ACTIONS:
│       □ Contact vendor for integration details
│       □ Request technical demo with our EMR
│       □ Get implementation cost breakdown
│
└─ Training Requirements - All Vendors:
    ├─ Lisa: "Extensive" - "Completely different workflow"
    ├─ Mark: "Moderate" - "2-day training acceptable"
    ├─ Operations: "Reasonable" - "Standard for software changes"
    └─ → RESOLUTION ACTIONS:
        □ Calculate training cost/time for each vendor
        □ Schedule team discussion on training timeline
        □ Consider phased rollout to minimize disruption
```

#### **Major Concerns Detection**
```
MAJOR CONCERNS 🔴  

├─ Vendor C: 3/4 stakeholders marked "Do Not Recommend"
│   ├─ Lisa: "Too complex for daily use"
│   ├─ Janet: "Security concerns with data handling"  
│   ├─ Mark: "Hidden costs in contract terms"
│   └─ → AUTO-RECOMMENDATION: "Eliminate Vendor C - multiple major concerns"
│
└─ Data Migration - All Vendors:
    ├─ Janet: "All vendors unclear on data migration process"
    ├─ Operations: "Critical - can't lose 5 years of appointment history"
    └─ → CRITICAL ACTION: "Data migration demo required before final decision"
```

### **Discussion Facilitation Interface**

#### **Conflict Resolution Workspace**
```
DISCUSSION: Ease of Use - Vendor A

📍 STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVES:

Lisa's Assessment: "Very Easy" ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
├─ "Interface looks exactly like what we use now"
├─ "Patients won't need to relearn check-in process"  
├─ "I could train new staff on this quickly"
└─ Priority: Daily workflow efficiency

Janet's Assessment: "Moderate" ⭐⭐⭐
├─ "User interface is simple but admin features are limited"
├─ "Reporting tools aren't as flexible as current system"
├─ "Might need workarounds for monthly reports"
└─ Priority: System administration capabilities

🎯 RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK:

COMMON GROUND:
├─ Both agree interface is clean and professional
├─ Both agree learning curve is manageable
└─ Both see value in vendor's approach

KEY DIFFERENCE:
├─ Lisa values: Daily ease vs Administrative power
├─ Janet values: Administrative control vs User simplicity
└─ Trade-off: Simple daily use vs Advanced admin features

RESOLUTION OPTIONS:
□ Schedule vendor demo: Admin interface deep-dive
□ Request feature comparison: Admin tools vs competitors
□ Test workaround solutions: Alternative reporting approaches
□ Accept limitation: If other benefits outweigh admin concerns
□ Negotiate enhancement: Ask vendor about admin tool improvements

### **Executive Summary Auto-Generation**

#### **Two-Paragraph Summary Template**
```
EXECUTIVE DECISION SUMMARY - SCHEDULING SOFTWARE SELECTION

RECOMMENDATION: Select Vendor A for clinic scheduling software implementation.

Based on comprehensive evaluation by four key stakeholders (Operations, IT, Front Desk, and Practice Administration), Vendor A provides the optimal balance of cost-effectiveness ($450/month), implementation speed (6-week deployment), and daily usability for front desk operations. While Vendor B offers more advanced administrative features, the $70/month cost difference and 2-week longer implementation timeline do not justify the additional complexity for our clinic's current needs. All stakeholders expressed confidence in Vendor A's HIPAA compliance and patient workflow integration.

Implementation will proceed with 6-week timeline, 2-day staff training program, and API integration with current EMR system. Janet (IT) will coordinate technical setup with additional vendor support for administrative features, while Lisa (Front Desk) will lead user acceptance testing during Week 4. Total first-year cost of $5,900 (including setup) represents 15% savings compared to Vendor B while meeting all operational requirements identified during evaluation process. Decision contingent on successful data migration demonstration scheduled for next week.

### **Conflict Detection Algorithm**

#### **Smart Variance Detection**
```javascript
function detectConflicts(assessments) {
  const conflicts = [];
  
  // Rating Variance Detection (>2 point spread on 1-10 scale)
  for (const criteria of criteriaList) {
    const ratings = assessments.map(a => a.ratings[criteria]);
    const variance = Math.max(...ratings) - Math.min(...ratings);
    
    if (variance >= 2) {

        criteria: criteria,
        variance: variance,
        positions: assessments.map(a => ({
          stakeholder: a.stakeholder_role,
          rating: a.ratings[criteria],
          reasoning: a.reasoning[criteria]
        }))
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Priority Mismatch Detection (different top priorities)
  const topPriorities = assessments.map(a => a.top_priority);
  if (new Set(topPriorities).size > 1) {
    conflicts.push({
      type: 'priority_mismatch',
      priorities: topPriorities,
      resolution_needed: 'stakeholder_discussion'
    });
  }
  
  // Major Concern Detection (any "Do Not Recommend")
  const majorConcerns = assessments.filter(a => 
    a.overall_recommendation === 'do_not_recommend'
  );
  
  if (majorConcerns.length > 0) {
    conflicts.push({
      type: 'major_concern',
      concerns: majorConcerns,
      severity: 'high',
      action_required: 'address_before_proceeding'
    });
  }
  
  return conflicts;
}
```

## **User Experience Specifications**

### **Progressive Disclosure Design**
- **Phase 1**: Only individual stakeholder sees their interface
- **Phase 2**: Shared view unlocks after all individual assessments complete
- **Phase 3**: Decision synthesis only accessible to Operations Manager

### **Mobile Responsiveness**
- **Primary Device**: Desktop for comprehensive assessments
- **Mobile Support**: View-only access for stakeholders to review decisions
- **Tablet Optimization**: Full functionality for Operations Manager on-the-go

### **Notification System**
```javascript
// Stakeholder Workflow Notifications
const notifications = {
  assessment_ready: "Your input needed: [Decision Name] vendor assessment",
  shared_review_open: "All assessments complete - review team input now",
  conflict_detected: "Discussion needed: [Criteria] has stakeholder disagreement",
  decision_ready: "Executive summary ready for [Decision Name]",
  action_required: "Your action needed to resolve [Specific Conflict]"
};
```
