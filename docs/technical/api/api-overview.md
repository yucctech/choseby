# Choseby API Documentation Summary

## Overview
The Choseby Healthcare Decision Platform API provides RESTful endpoints for team-based decision facilitation specifically designed for healthcare environments. The API supports three distinct workflow types optimized for different decision scenarios.

## Key Features

### üè• Healthcare-Specific Design
- **HIPAA Compliance**: All endpoints maintain audit trails and data protection
- **Patient Impact Assessment**: Integrated patient safety impact scoring
- **Regulatory Calendar**: Automatic deadline tracking and compliance monitoring
- **Clinical Terminology**: Healthcare-specific roles, departments, and decision types

### üîÑ Three Workflow Types
1. **Emergency Workflow**: Critical decisions requiring immediate action
   - Bypasses normal approval processes
   - Retrospective documentation within 48 hours
   - Authorized by clinical leads, administrators, or CEO

2. **Express Workflow**: Simple decisions (<$10K, <2 weeks timeline)
   - 3-phase simplified process: Define & Evaluate ‚Üí Decide & Document ‚Üí Implement & Monitor
   - 24-hour evaluation window
   - Streamlined for operational efficiency

3. **Full DECIDE Workflow**: Complex decisions using complete 6-phase methodology
   - Define Problem ‚Üí Establish Criteria ‚Üí Consider Options ‚Üí Identify Best ‚Üí Develop Action ‚Üí Evaluate & Monitor
   - Anonymous evaluation system with conflict detection
   - Professional documentation generation

### ü§ê Anonymous Evaluation System
- **Complete Anonymity**: Individual scores never revealed
- **Conflict Detection**: Real-time variance analysis identifies disagreements
- **Conflict Resolution**: Anonymous discussion forums and facilitated meetings
- **Bias Protection**: Statistical analysis prevents hierarchy pressure

### ‚ö° Real-time Collaboration
- **WebSocket Integration**: Live updates for team progress
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch-friendly interfaces for healthcare environments
- **Offline Capability**: Works in areas with poor connectivity
- **Participation Enforcement**: Escalation ladder ensures team engagement

## API Architecture

### Authentication & Security
- **JWT Bearer Tokens**: Secure authentication with refresh capability
- **SSO Integration**: Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, and custom healthcare systems
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests per hour per team
- **Data Retention**: 7-year compliance requirement support

### Core Resources
- **Teams**: Healthcare team management with role-based permissions
- **Decisions**: Decision creation and workflow management
- **Evaluations**: Anonymous team member scoring system
- **Conflicts**: Automated conflict detection and resolution
- **Documents**: Professional report generation (board reports, audit trails)
- **Analytics**: Team performance and decision quality metrics

### Workflow Management
- **Phase Progression**: Automatic advancement through DECIDE methodology
- **Validation Rules**: Healthcare-specific requirements and constraints
- **Override Protection**: Mandatory justification for recommendation bypasses
- **Emergency Bypass**: Critical decision handling with retrospective documentation
