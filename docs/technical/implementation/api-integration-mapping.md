# API Integration Mapping - CHOSEBY Healthcare Decision Platform

**Purpose**: UX-optimized API specifications for component requirements  
**Context**: API redesign to support optimal healthcare user experience  
**Approach**: UX-first development - Update existing OpenAPI to match component needs

---

## ðŸ”„ **UX-FIRST API STRATEGY**

### **Current State vs Required State**
- **Current**: API-constrained UX design (40+ endpoints, mobile-limited)
- **Required**: UX-optimized API design (component-driven endpoints)
- **Approach**: Redesign API to support optimal healthcare workflows

### **Core Philosophy Shift**
```yaml
# OLD APPROACH (API-First)
API Design â†’ Frontend Constraints â†’ Suboptimal UX

# NEW APPROACH (UX-First)  
Optimal UX â†’ Component Requirements â†’ API Redesign â†’ Superior Healthcare Workflows
```
