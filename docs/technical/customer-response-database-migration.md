# Customer Response Database Migration Plan
## Platform Modification Strategy for Customer Response Context

### Migration Overview

**Objective**: Modify existing healthcare decision platform database for customer response workflows without losing existing infrastructure benefits.

**Strategy**: Extend current schemas with customer response context rather than rebuild, maintaining 95% of existing backend infrastructure.

**Timeline**: 2-day migration process with zero downtime using blue-green deployment approach.

## Current Database Assessment

### Existing Schema Assets (Reusable)

**Core Decision Infrastructure**:
- `decisions` table with team coordination and workflow tracking ✅
- `team_members` table with role-based access control ✅
- `decision_criteria` table with weighted evaluation framework ✅
- `decision_options` table with anonymous evaluation system ✅
- `decision_evaluations` table with conflict detection (2.5 variance threshold) ✅
- `audit_logs` table with complete decision history tracking ✅

**Authentication and Security**:
- JWT token management with team-based permissions ✅
- Role-based access control for stakeholder coordination ✅
- Audit trail compliance suitable for customer data privacy ✅
- Data encryption and secure API access patterns ✅

## Schema Extension Plan

### Phase 1: Customer Response Context (Day 1)

**Extend Decisions Table for Customer Response**:
```sql
-- Add customer response specific columns
ALTER TABLE decisions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_id VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE decisions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_context JSONB DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE decisions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS response_urgency INTEGER DEFAULT 3 
    CHECK (response_urgency >= 1 AND response_urgency <= 5);
ALTER TABLE decisions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_tier VARCHAR(20) 
    CHECK (customer_tier IN ('basic', 'premium', 'enterprise', 'vip'));
ALTER TABLE decisions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS financial_impact DECIMAL(10,2);
ALTER TABLE decisions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS expected_resolution_hours INTEGER;

-- Add indices for customer response queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_customer_id ON decisions(customer_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_response_urgency ON decisions(response_urgency);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_customer_tier ON decisions(customer_tier);
```

**Update Team Member Roles for Customer-Facing Teams**:
```sql
-- Extend team member roles for customer response context
ALTER TABLE team_members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_role VARCHAR(50) 
    CHECK (customer_role IN ('support_manager', 'account_manager', 'customer_success', 'sales', 'legal', 'operations'));
ALTER TABLE team_members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS customer_expertise_areas TEXT[];
ALTER TABLE team_members ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS escalation_authority_level INTEGER DEFAULT 1;

-- Update existing healthcare roles to customer response roles
UPDATE team_members SET customer_role = 'support_manager' WHERE role LIKE '%support%' OR role LIKE '%service%';
UPDATE team_members SET customer_role = 'account_manager' WHERE role LIKE '%account%' OR role LIKE '%relationship%';
UPDATE team_members SET customer_role = 'operations' WHERE role LIKE '%operations%' OR role LIKE '%admin%';
```

### Phase 2: Customer Response Decision Types (Day 1)

**Create Customer Response Type Classification**:
```sql
-- Customer response decision type lookup table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_response_types (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    description TEXT,
    default_stakeholders JSONB,
    urgency_weight DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.0,
    expected_resolution_hours INTEGER,
    financial_impact_threshold DECIMAL(10,2),
    escalation_criteria JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Insert common customer response decision types
INSERT INTO customer_response_types (name, description, default_stakeholders, urgency_weight, expected_resolution_hours, financial_impact_threshold) VALUES
('refund_request', 'Customer refund policy interpretation and exception decisions', 
 '["support_manager", "account_manager", "legal"]', 1.2, 24, 1000.00),
('billing_dispute', 'Billing disagreement resolution requiring policy and relationship considerations', 
 '["support_manager", "account_manager", "legal", "operations"]', 1.1, 48, 2500.00),
('service_escalation', 'Complex service issue requiring cross-functional coordination', 
 '["support_manager", "customer_success", "operations"]', 1.4, 12, 500.00),
('contract_modification', 'Customer contract change requests impacting terms or pricing', 
 '["account_manager", "sales", "legal"]', 1.0, 72, 10000.00),
('policy_exception', 'Customer request requiring deviation from standard policies', 
 '["support_manager", "operations", "legal"]', 1.1, 24, 1500.00),
('churn_prevention', 'High-value customer retention decisions requiring strategic coordination', 
 '["customer_success", "account_manager", "sales", "operations"]', 1.5, 6, 25000.00);
```

### Phase 3: Outcome Tracking Enhancement (Day 2)

**Customer Response Outcome Measurement**:
```sql
-- Track customer response decision outcomes
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customer_response_outcomes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    decision_id INTEGER REFERENCES decisions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    customer_satisfaction_score INTEGER CHECK (customer_satisfaction_score >= 1 AND customer_satisfaction_score <= 10),
    escalation_occurred BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    escalation_level VARCHAR(20) CHECK (escalation_level IN ('none', 'supervisor', 'management', 'executive', 'legal')),
    financial_impact_actual DECIMAL(10,2),
    resolution_time_hours INTEGER,
    customer_retention_impact VARCHAR(20) CHECK (customer_retention_impact IN ('positive', 'neutral', 'negative', 'churn_risk', 'churn_occurred')),
    follow_up_required BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    follow_up_scheduled_date TIMESTAMP,
    outcome_notes TEXT,
    satisfaction_survey_response JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- AI recommendation effectiveness tracking
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ai_recommendation_feedback (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    decision_id INTEGER REFERENCES decisions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    recommendation_type VARCHAR(50) CHECK (recommendation_type IN ('classification', 'stakeholder_suggestion', 'response_draft', 'risk_assessment')),
    ai_suggestion TEXT,
    stakeholder_approval_rating INTEGER CHECK (stakeholder_approval_rating >= 1 AND stakeholder_approval_rating <= 5),
    final_decision_alignment BOOLEAN,
    accuracy_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    improvement_suggestions TEXT,
    ai_confidence_score DECIMAL(3,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Data Migration Strategy

### Existing Data Preservation

**Healthcare to Customer Response Context Mapping**:
```sql
-- Migrate existing healthcare decisions to customer response context
UPDATE decisions SET 
    customer_context = jsonb_build_object(
        'migrated_from', 'healthcare',
        'original_context', problem_statement,
        'migration_date', NOW()
    )
WHERE customer_context IS NULL OR customer_context = '{}';

-- Set default response urgency for existing decisions
UPDATE decisions SET response_urgency = 3 WHERE response_urgency IS NULL;

-- Map existing team member roles to customer response roles
UPDATE team_members SET customer_role = 
    CASE 
        WHEN role ILIKE '%doctor%' OR role ILIKE '%physician%' THEN 'support_manager'
        WHEN role ILIKE '%nurse%' OR role ILIKE '%care%' THEN 'customer_success'
        WHEN role ILIKE '%admin%' OR role ILIKE '%operations%' THEN 'operations'
        WHEN role ILIKE '%manager%' THEN 'account_manager'
        ELSE 'support_manager'
    END
WHERE customer_role IS NULL;
```

**Data Integrity Validation**:
```sql
-- Verify migration data integrity
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_decisions,
    COUNT(customer_context) as decisions_with_context,
    COUNT(response_urgency) as decisions_with_urgency,
    AVG(CASE WHEN customer_context != '{}' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as context_completion_rate
FROM decisions;

-- Verify team member role migration
SELECT 
    customer_role,
    COUNT(*) as member_count,
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT role) as original_roles
FROM team_members 
GROUP BY customer_role;
```

### Zero-Downtime Migration Process

**Blue-Green Deployment Strategy**:

1. **Green Environment Setup**:
   - Create replica database with customer response schema extensions
   - Apply all migration scripts to green environment
   - Validate data integrity and application compatibility

2. **Application Update**:
   - Deploy customer response API updates to green environment
   - Test customer response workflows end-to-end
   - Validate AI integration and outcome tracking

3. **Traffic Migration**:
   - Route new customer response decisions to green environment
   - Gradually migrate existing decision workflows
   - Monitor performance and rollback capability

4. **Blue Environment Deprecation**:
   - Complete traffic migration to green environment
   - Archive blue environment data for backup
   - Update DNS and infrastructure references

## Performance Optimization

### Index Strategy for Customer Response Queries

**Customer Response Specific Indices**:
```sql
-- Optimize customer response decision queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_customer_response ON decisions(customer_id, response_urgency, created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_financial_impact ON decisions(financial_impact) WHERE financial_impact IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_customer_response_outcomes_satisfaction ON customer_response_outcomes(customer_satisfaction_score, created_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_ai_feedback_effectiveness ON ai_recommendation_feedback(recommendation_type, accuracy_score);

-- Composite indices for common customer response queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_urgent_customer ON decisions(response_urgency, customer_tier, created_at) 
WHERE response_urgency >= 4;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_outcomes_retention_impact ON customer_response_outcomes(customer_retention_impact, created_at) 
WHERE customer_retention_impact IN ('negative', 'churn_risk', 'churn_occurred');
```

**Query Performance Optimization**:
```sql
-- Optimize frequent customer response queries
-- Most urgent customer decisions requiring immediate attention
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT d.*, t.name as team_name 
FROM decisions d 
JOIN teams t ON d.team_id = t.id 
WHERE d.response_urgency >= 4 
  AND d.status = 'in_progress' 
ORDER BY d.response_urgency DESC, d.created_at ASC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Customer satisfaction correlation with decision quality
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT 
    d.customer_tier,
    AVG(cro.customer_satisfaction_score) as avg_satisfaction,
    AVG(d.financial_impact) as avg_financial_impact,
    COUNT(*) as decision_count
FROM decisions d
JOIN customer_response_outcomes cro ON d.id = cro.decision_id
WHERE d.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY d.customer_tier;
```

## Testing and Validation

### Migration Testing Framework

**Pre-Migration Testing**:
- **Schema Validation**: All new tables and columns created successfully
- **Data Type Validation**: Customer response data types and constraints working
- **Foreign Key Integrity**: Relationship preservation between tables
- **Index Performance**: Query performance maintained or improved

**Post-Migration Testing**:
- **Data Integrity**: All existing decisions accessible with customer response context
- **API Compatibility**: Existing API endpoints continue to function
- **Customer Response Workflows**: New customer response decision creation and completion
- **Performance Validation**: Response times <2 seconds for all customer response queries

### Rollback Strategy

**Migration Rollback Plan**:
```sql
-- Emergency rollback script (if needed)
-- Remove customer response specific columns
ALTER TABLE decisions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS customer_id;
ALTER TABLE decisions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS customer_context;
ALTER TABLE decisions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS response_urgency;
ALTER TABLE decisions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS customer_tier;
ALTER TABLE decisions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS financial_impact;
ALTER TABLE decisions DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS expected_resolution_hours;

-- Remove customer response specific tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_response_outcomes;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ai_recommendation_feedback;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer_response_types;

-- Restore team member roles
ALTER TABLE team_members DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS customer_role;
ALTER TABLE team_members DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS customer_expertise_areas;
ALTER TABLE team_members DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS escalation_authority_level;
```

**Rollback Decision Criteria**:
- Migration completion time >4 hours
- Data integrity issues affecting >5% of records
- API performance degradation >20%
- Customer response workflow functionality failures
