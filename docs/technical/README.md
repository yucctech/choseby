## 🔧 Development Resources

### Development Priorities
1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Go backend API server with PostgreSQL integration using provided schemas
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: React/Next.js frontend implementation of 26 screens with conflict resolution workflow
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-8)**: Real-time collaboration features and healthcare compliance optimization

### Critical Implementation Requirements
**Anonymous Evaluation System**:
- Session-based anonymous scoring to prevent hierarchy pressure in medical teams
- Conflict detection algorithm with 2.5 variance threshold for automated disagreement identification  
- Real-time conflict alerts for team facilitators during decision processes

**Healthcare Team Workflow Support**:
- Support 3 workflow types: Emergency (<2 hours), Express (<2 days), Full DECIDE methodology
- Anonymous evaluation system that preserves individual privacy throughout decision process
- Conflict detection that triggers facilitated resolution processes with professional documentation
- HIPAA-compliant audit trails with regulatory tagging for Joint Commission and CMS compliance

**Technical Implementation Standards**:
- Response Time: <2 seconds for all decision workflow interactions
- Platform Uptime: 99.9% availability for pilot healthcare teams  
- Security: Zero HIPAA violations with complete audit trail coverage
- Scalability: Support 5+ teams simultaneously without performance degradation

### Performance & Security
- **Database Optimization**: Indexes for conflict detection and team operations
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis implementation for team data (15-min TTL)
- **Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests/hour per team for healthcare usage patterns
- **Security Standards**: Healthcare-grade data protection and authentication

## 📊 Success Metrics
