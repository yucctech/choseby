# Testing Documentation

This folder contains all testing-related documentation for the Choseby Customer Response Platform.

## Quick Reference

### Automated Testing (Run on Every Commit)

**Backend Go Tests** - Located in `backend/*_test.go`
```bash
cd backend
make local  # Fast validation (10 sec) - run before every push
make test   # Full test suite with coverage
```

**Testing Infrastructure**:
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD runs automatically on push
- ✅ golangci-lint with 50+ code quality checks
- ✅ Security scanning with gosec
- ✅ 22.5% baseline coverage → 60%+ target after customers

### Manual Testing Scripts

**JavaScript Test Scripts** - Located in `scripts/test/`
```bash
# Run from repository root with backend running
node scripts/test/test-complete-e2e-workflow.js
node scripts/test/test-analytics.js
node scripts/test/test-phase-6-outcome.js
```

## Test Documentation Files

### 1. TESTING_STATUS.md
**Status**: Week 1 Complete (Oct 2, 2025)
**Content**:
- Integration test results (all 9 workflow steps passing)
- Unit test tech debt status (mock issues documented)
- Coverage metrics and targets
- Week 1 completion verification

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ Integration tests prove complete E2E workflow functional
- ⚠️ Unit test mocks need updating (not blocking - tech debt)
- ✅ Database schema deployed and working (migrations 001, 002, 003)

### 2. E2E_TEST_RESULTS.md
**Status**: Week 2 Frontend Validation (Oct 7, 2025)
**Content**:
- Playwright E2E test results
- 100+ tests written across 4 test suites
- Critical bugs discovered requiring fixes
- Test infrastructure quality assessment

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ 2/9 authentication tests passing (22%)
- ❌ Critical: Dashboard not protected (security vulnerability)
- ❌ High: Form validation errors not displayed
- ❌ High: Demo user missing from database

## Testing Strategy

### Philosophy
- **Fast feedback**: `make local` catches 90% of issues in 10 seconds
- **Safety net**: GitHub Actions catches remaining issues
- **Quality over coverage**: 1 good integration test > 100 shallow unit tests
- **Test what matters**: Business logic, not boilerplate

### Test Pyramid
```
        /\
       /  \    E2E Tests (few, high-value)
      /----\
     /      \  Integration Tests (some, critical paths)
    /--------\
   /          \ Unit Tests (many, fast feedback)
  /------------\
```

### When to Update Tests
- ✅ Add new feature → Add unit test
- ✅ Fix bug → Add regression test
- ✅ Change API → Update integration test
- ❌ Don't write tests just for coverage

## Current Test Coverage

### Backend
- **22.5% baseline coverage** (established with testing infrastructure)
- **Target: 60%+ after first 5 customers**
- Integration test covers complete customer response workflow
- Unit tests need mock updates (documented tech debt)

### Frontend
- **100+ Playwright E2E tests** written across 4 suites
- **22% passing** due to authentication blocking issues
- Critical bugs identified and documented for fixing
- 41 tests blocked waiting for auth fixes

## Running Tests

### Pre-Commit (Automatic via Git Hook)
```bash
cd backend && make local
```
- Runs in 10 seconds
- Format + vet + fast tests
- Catches 90% of issues

### On Push (Automatic via GitHub Actions)
- Full test suite
- Integration tests
- golangci-lint (50+ checks)
- Security scan (gosec)

### Manual Integration Test
```bash
cd backend
bash run_integration_tests.sh
```

### Manual E2E Tests (Frontend)
```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright test                    # All tests
npx playwright test auth.spec.ts       # Authentication only
npx playwright test --ui               # Interactive mode
```

## Test Maintenance

### Tech Debt (Low Priority - After First Customers)
1. Update unit test mocks to match current handler behavior
2. Fix frontend authentication bugs (security critical)
3. Create demo user in database for testing
4. Add proper form labels for accessibility

### Future Improvements
- Replace brittle unit tests with more integration tests
- Test against real database instead of mocks
- Add retry logic for flaky network tests
- Create test data fixtures
- Implement custom test commands for common flows
