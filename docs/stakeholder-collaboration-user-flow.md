## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (CRITICAL)

### **1. SIMPLICITY OVER SOPHISTICATION**
- **Rule**: If it requires explanation, it's too complex
- **Test**: Could a busy operations manager use this during lunch break?

### **2. ENHANCEMENT OVER REPLACEMENT**
- **Rule**: Augment current workflows, don't force new methodologies
- **Test**: Does this feel like natural evolution of spreadsheet comparison?

### **3. POLITICAL NEUTRALITY**
- **Rule**: No features that create interpersonal hierarchy or conflict
- **Test**: Would team members feel comfortable using this together?

### **4. IMMEDIATE VALUE**
- **Rule**: Value visible within first 10 minutes of use
- **Test**: Can user see clear improvement over current process immediately?

---

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS FOR DEVELOPMENT

### **Technology Stack (Budget-Conscious)**
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js (standard web app)
- **Backend**: Node.js with simple database
- **AI Requirements**: NONE (major cost savings vs original DeepSeek integration)
- **Hosting**: Vercel/Netlify free tiers initially
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on free tier

### **Development Budget**: $15K Maximum
- **Savings vs Original**: $20K (no complex AI framework integration)
- **Timeline**: 3-4 months vs 8-10 months original

---

## VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Wireframe Testing Protocol (Week 3-4)**
Must test with **3 customers minimum**:
1. **Healthcare**: Different clinic than Interview #9
2. **Professional Services**: Accounting or legal firm
3. **Alternative Industry**: Manufacturing or financial services

### **Success Criteria for Each Test**
‚úÖ **Usability**: Can complete vendor comparison in <30 minutes  
‚úÖ **Value Recognition**: Prefers this approach over current process  
‚úÖ **Pricing Acceptance**: Confirms $3,600 annual worth it  
‚úÖ **Output Satisfaction**: Executive summary format meets needs  

### **Failure Indicators (Require Further Pivot)**
‚ùå **Still too complex**: More than 30 minutes to complete  
‚ùå **Prefers status quo**: Doesn't see enough improvement  
‚ùå **Pricing resistance**: Questions value at $3,600  
‚ùå **Format rejection**: Output doesn't meet executive needs
