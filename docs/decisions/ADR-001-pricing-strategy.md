# ADR-001: Customer Response Platform Pricing Strategy

## Status
**APPROVED** - Team-based pricing implemented for customer response platform

## Context
Customer response decision intelligence platform targeting customer-facing teams with clear ROI demonstration through response time improvement and customer satisfaction correlation.

## Decision
**Customer Response Team-Based Pricing Strategy**: Focus on customer response team efficiency value

### Customer Response Team-Based Pricing (Implemented)
- **Small Response Team**: $199/month (3-8 members)
  - Core customer response decision workflow
  - AI classification and summarization
  - 90-day outcome tracking
  - Email support + knowledge base

- **Standard Response Team**: $399/month (9-15 members)
  - Advanced AI analysis and option generation
  - Custom response templates and workflows  
  - 1-year outcome tracking with analytics
  - Priority support + monthly success check-ins

- **Large Response Team**: $699/month (16-25 members)
  - Team-specific AI model training
  - Advanced analytics and benchmarking
  - Custom integrations (Zendesk, Salesforce, etc.)
  - Dedicated customer success manager

### Customer Response ROI Rationale
**Time Savings Value**: 12 hours/week saved = $2,400/month in team productivity
**Customer Satisfaction**: Faster response times improve NPS and reduce churn
**Team Efficiency**: Structured decision process eliminates coordination chaos
**Cost Justification**: 3-12x ROI at $199-699/month pricing vs $2,400/month value

### Customer Response Market Validation
- **SaaS Companies**: $300-800/month budgets for customer response efficiency
- **E-commerce**: $200-600/month for support team coordination
- **Professional Services**: $250-500/month for client response coordination
- **B2B Services**: $400-700/month for account management efficiency

## Alternatives Considered

### Individual Pricing Model (Rejected for MVP)
- **Per-user**: $21.50/user/month
- **Rationale**: Lower revenue per customer, harder ROI demonstration
- **Future Consideration**: Post-MVP expansion for smaller teams

### Enterprise Custom Pricing (Post-MVP)
- **25+ team members**: Custom pricing based on usage and integrations
- **Implementation**: After validating team-based model success

## Consequences

### Positive Outcomes
- **Clear ROI**: Direct correlation between pricing and customer response team value
- **Higher Revenue**: $199-699/month vs $21.50/user individual pricing
- **Market Fit**: Aligns with customer response team budget authority and spending patterns
- **Scalability**: Team growth increases subscription value naturally

### Monitoring Requirements
- **Customer Response Team Size**: Track actual team sizes vs pricing tiers
- **Usage Patterns**: Monitor decision frequency and team engagement
- **ROI Demonstration**: Measure response time improvement and customer satisfaction correlation
- **Competitive Response**: Watch for customer service platform pricing reactions

**Success Metrics**: 5 customer response teams paying $199-699/month by Week 8 for $500+ MRR through demonstrable response time and customer satisfaction improvements.
