### CRITICAL CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS (From Interview #9)
**Healthcare Operations Manager Feedback**:

**What They Want**:
- *"Template that helps organize vendor comparisons consistently"*
- *"Industry-specific question sets - like 'questions to ask scheduling software vendors'"*
- *"Simple pros/cons organization tools"*
- *"Reference check tracking"*  
- *"Two-paragraph executive summaries"* (not pages of analysis)

**What They Explicitly Reject**:
- Numerical scoring systems (*"false precision"*)
- Stakeholder weighting (*"can't tell front desk supervisor her opinion matters less"*)
- Complex risk matrices (*"academic, designed by consultants"*)
- Multi-page analytical reports (*"executives want two paragraphs"*)

### VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS FOR WIREFRAMES
**Testing Protocol** (Week 3-4 after wireframe completion):

**Test with 3 customers minimum**:
1. **Healthcare**: Different clinic than Interview #9
2. **Professional Services**: Accounting or legal firm  
3. **Alternative Industry**: Manufacturing or financial services

**Success Criteria for Each Test**:
✅ **Usability**: Can complete vendor comparison in <30 minutes
✅ **Value Recognition**: Prefers this approach over current process

❌ **Pricing resistance**: Questions value at $3,600
❌ **Format rejection**: Output doesn't meet executive needs

### TARGET MARKET PROFILE

**Industries**: Professional services, healthcare, manufacturing

### COMPETITIVE POSITION
**Advantage**: 60-75% cost savings vs consultant engagements
**Differentiation**: Simple templates vs complex frameworks
**Market Gap**: Enhanced process structure without methodology replacement
