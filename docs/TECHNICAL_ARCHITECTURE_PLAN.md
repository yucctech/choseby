### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Teams table
CREATE TABLE teams (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Users table  
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Team members with roles
CREATE TABLE team_members (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  role VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'admin', 'member', 'observer'
  expertise_area VARCHAR(100), -- 'CEO', 'CTO', 'Operations', etc.
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Decisions
CREATE TABLE decisions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  team_id UUID REFERENCES teams(id),
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active', -- 'active', 'resolved', 'archived'
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Evaluation criteria
CREATE TABLE criteria (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  decision_id UUID REFERENCES decisions(id),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  weight INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Anonymous scores
CREATE TABLE scores (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  decision_id UUID REFERENCES decisions(id),
  criteria_id UUID REFERENCES criteria(id),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  score INTEGER NOT NULL, -- 1-5 or 1-10 scale
  rationale TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Conflicts detected
CREATE TABLE conflicts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  decision_id UUID REFERENCES decisions(id),
  criteria_id UUID REFERENCES criteria(id),
  conflict_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'high_variance', 'opposing_views'
  description TEXT,
  resolved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Security & Multi-Tenancy
```typescript
// Row Level Security policies
-- Users can only access teams they belong to
CREATE POLICY team_member_access ON teams
  FOR ALL USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Users can only see their own scores
CREATE POLICY own_scores_only ON scores
  FOR ALL USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Team admins can see all team data
CREATE POLICY team_admin_access ON decisions
  FOR ALL USING (
    team_id IN (
      SELECT team_id FROM team_members 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );
```

## PILOT CUSTOMER STRATEGY (REVISED)

### Standard SaaS Platform Approach ✅
**NOT Custom Development - Standard Platform Testing**

#### Pilot Customer Structure
- **3-month commitment** to test standard platform features
- **50% discount pricing** for feedback and testimonials  
- **Regular feedback sessions** for product improvement (not customization)
- **Testimonial/case study participation** for marketing validation
- **Path to full pricing** after successful pilot period

#### Customer Validation Focus
- **Standard Features**: Same platform for all customers, no customization
- **Usage Validation**: Confirm customers use weekly and see 10:1+ ROI
- **Pricing Validation**: Willingness to pay full price ($129-172/month) post-pilot
- **Referral Validation**: Customers recommend to other leadership teams

#### Revenue Protection
- **Avoid Consulting Trap**: No custom development or industry-specific builds
- **Scalable Feedback**: Insights improve standard product for all customers
- **SaaS Model Integrity**: Multi-tenant platform serving multiple teams identically

---

## TECHNICAL RISK MITIGATION

### Development Velocity Optimization
**Proven Technology Stack**: NextAuth.js, Supabase, Vercel for rapid development
**Feature Scope Discipline**: 80% solution that customers pay for vs perfect features
**Customer Feedback Loop**: Daily pilot customer feedback integration
**Technical Debt Management**: Acceptable for MVP if it enables customer revenue

### Multi-User Platform Complexity
**Authentication**: NextAuth.js with team-based sessions (proven solution)
**Database**: Supabase Row Level Security for multi-tenant data isolation
**Real-Time**: Start with polling, upgrade to WebSockets in Phase 2
**Conflict Detection**: Simple variance algorithm initially, ML sophistication later

### Security & Compliance Requirements
**Healthcare Customer Requirements**: HIPAA-compliant data handling from Day 1
**Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Row Level Security preventing data leakage between teams
**Professional Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication and data protection
**GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: User data deletion, privacy policy, consent management
