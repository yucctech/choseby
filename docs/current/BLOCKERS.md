# Current Blockers & Dependencies - Customer Response Platform

## Active Blockers
**Status**: No current blockers identified for customer response platform development

## Customer Response Platform Development Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
**Risk**: Database schema complexity for customer response context
- **Mitigation**: Complete PostgreSQL schema specification ready for implementation
- **Resources**: `docs/technical/database-schema.md` provides implementation-ready design
- **Timeline**: Database setup estimated 2-3 days with customer response optimization

**Risk**: DeepSeek AI integration for customer issue classification
- **Mitigation**: DeepSeek API documentation available, fallback to manual classification
- **Cost Control**: DeepSeek chosen for cost-effectiveness vs OpenAI
- **Implementation**: AI classification enhancement, not blocking core workflow

### Business Risks
**Risk**: Customer response team pilot conversion challenges
- **Mitigation**: Target customer success managers with clear ROI demonstration
- **Backup**: Multiple customer response market segments (SaaS, e-commerce, professional services)
- **Timeline**: Customer acquisition parallel to platform development

**Risk**: Customer response platform adoption by existing teams
- **Mitigation**: Mobile-first design for urgent customer response scenarios
- **Value Demonstration**: Clear response time improvement and customer satisfaction correlation
- **Success Metrics**: 60%+ response time reduction target provides clear value proposition

### Customer Response Market Risks
**Risk**: Existing customer service tools adding decision features
- **Mitigation**: First-mover advantage in customer response decision intelligence category
- **Differentiation**: Decision intelligence vs communication efficiency focus
- **Speed**: 8-week MVP timeline to establish market presence

**Risk**: Customer response teams lacking budget authority
- **Mitigation**: Target companies with established customer operations tool spending
- **Validation**: $200-800/month customer response tool budgets identified in research
- **ROI**: Clear time savings calculation ($2,400/month value vs $199-699/month cost)
