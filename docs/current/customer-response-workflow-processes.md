## Customer Response Platform Project Management

### Documentation Structure for Customer Response Focus
- **Business Strategy**: `docs/business/` (customer response market, customer development, competitive analysis)
- **Technical Implementation**: `docs/technical/` (API specs, database schema, frontend components)
- **Current Sprint**: `docs/current/` (active tasks, sprint planning, workflow processes)
- **Customer Acquisition**: `docs/business/customer-success/` (pilot conversion, onboarding processes)

### AI Session Coordination for Customer Response Development
**Claude Code Sessions**:
- Focus on customer response platform technical implementation
- Use `docs/technical/implementation-summary.md` as starting point
- Prioritize customer response workflows and AI integration
- Coordinate with database schema and API specifications

**Claude Desktop Sessions**:
- Focus on customer response business strategy and customer development
- Use `docs/ai-context/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONTEXT.md` for customer response context
- Update customer response market strategy and competitive analysis
- Plan customer acquisition activities for customer response teams

### Customer Response Team Communication Workflow
**Customer Development Activities**:
1. Identify target customer response teams (SaaS, e-commerce, professional services)
2. Conduct customer response validation interviews using enhanced methodology
3. Update customer response pain points and pricing validation documentation
4. Convert validated prospects to pilot customers for MVP testing

**Technical Development Coordination**:
1. Ensure customer response requirements drive technical implementation priorities
2. Coordinate AI integration for customer response classification and recommendations
3. Focus frontend development on customer response team workflows
4. Prioritize outcome tracking for customer satisfaction correlation

## Customer Response Success Metrics Tracking

### Weekly Customer Response KPIs
- **Development Progress**: Customer response platform implementation completion %
- **Customer Acquisition**: Customer response team interviews completed and pilot conversions
- **Technical Metrics**: API endpoint completion, frontend component implementation
- **Business Metrics**: Customer response validation progress and pricing acceptance

### Customer Response Platform Risk Management
**Development Risks**:
- Scope creep beyond customer response use case → Focus on customer-facing team workflows only
- Technical complexity blocking customer response MVP → Use existing infrastructure, minimal customization
- Customer acquisition delays → Leverage existing network, focus on SaaS customer success managers

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Strict customer response scope boundaries with 8-week timeline protection
- 95% infrastructure reuse strategy minimizing technical implementation risk
- Customer success manager network activation for rapid pilot customer acquisition

## Customer Response Project Success Criteria

### 8-Week MVP Success Targets
- **Technical**: Customer response platform deployed with core decision workflow functional
- **Customer**: 5 customer response teams acquired at $199-699/month pricing
- **Revenue**: $500+ MRR from customer response team efficiency improvements
- **Validation**: Customer response time improvement and customer satisfaction correlation demonstrated

### Daily Success Habits for Customer Response Platform
- **Morning**: Start with highest-impact customer response development task
- **Documentation**: Update customer response progress in real-time vs end-of-day catchup
- **Customer Focus**: Every development decision filtered through customer response team value
- **AI Coordination**: Use AI for acceleration, not exploration - focus on customer response implementation

**Workflow Success**: Consistent daily progress on customer response platform development with clear weekly milestones and customer acquisition activities that build toward $500+ MRR by Week 8.
