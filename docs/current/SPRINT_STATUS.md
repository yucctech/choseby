## Sprint Metrics & Validation

### Research-Based Success Criteria (From Documents)
- **Decision Speed**: Target 30-40% reduction in cycle time (validated research benchmark)
- **Conflict Resolution**: >80% conflict resolution rate through structured facilitation
- **Customer Satisfaction**: 90%+ satisfaction rate (based on validation interview patterns)
- **Revenue Validation**: $500+ MRR by Week 8 from 5 healthcare pilot customers

### Technical Performance Targets
- **Platform Uptime**: 99.9% availability for pilot customers
- **Response Time**: <2 seconds for all decision workflow interactions
- **Security**: Zero HIPAA compliance violations, complete audit trails
- **Scalability**: Support 5+ teams simultaneously without performance degradation

## Risk Management & Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies Identified
- **Healthcare team availability**: Methodology validation sessions required Week 3-4
- **Customer conversion pipeline**: 5 pilot customers needed for revenue validation
- **HIPAA compliance**: Healthcare data handling requirements throughout development
- **AI integration decision**: Framework generation vs manual processes based on testing

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Simplified 4-phase fallback**: If 6-phase DECIDE proves too complex during validation
- **Multiple customer pipeline**: Backup validation participants identified
- **Compliance-first development**: HIPAA requirements integrated from database design forward

## Next Sprint Focus (Week 3-4): Platform Development & Customer Validation
- Core DECIDE workflow implementation with healthcare customization
- Anonymous evaluation system with bias detection
- 3 healthcare team methodology validation sessions
- Convert validation participants to signed pilot agreements
- Conflict detection and resolution interface development

## Team Coordination
**Solo Founder + AI Team**: Documentation restructure enables seamless AI context preservation
**Customer Development**: Virtual interview insights feeding into technical requirements
