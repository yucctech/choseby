### Database Setup (Priority 1 - Blocking Development)

- [ ] **Create team_members table** with role assignments ('admin', 'member', 'observer')
- [ ] **Create decisions table** for team decision workflows
- [ ] **Create scores table** for anonymous team member evaluations
- [ ] **Implement Row Level Security policies** for multi-tenant team isolation

*Success Criteria: Teams can create decisions and members can score anonymously*

### Development Environment (Priority 2)
- [ ] **Create Next.js 14 project** with TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- [ ] **Install Supabase client and Shadcn/ui components**
- [ ] **Configure code quality tools**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode
- [ ] **Set up testing framework**: Jest, React Testing Library
- [ ] **Configure error monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Supabase Dashboard

*Success Criteria: Clean development environment with quality tooling*

## Business Development (Priority 3)

### Customer Conversion
- [ ] **Re-engage strongest validation interview customers** for pilot agreements
- [ ] **Draft pilot customer agreement**: Standard platform, 50% pricing, 3-month commitment
- [ ] **Set up customer feedback workflow**: Weekly calls, usage tracking

*Success Criteria: 3 pilot customer agreements signed for Week 2 onboarding*

## Week 1 Success Definition
**Technical**: Supabase + Vercel + Next.js foundation working with team authentication
**Business**: Pilot customer pipeline established for Week 2 onboarding
**Process**: Development workflow established with AI context management

## Blockers & Dependencies
**Current**: None - Documentation structure complete, ready for implementation
**Risk**: Supabase FREE tier limits (500MB database, 50K users) - monitor usage
**Mitigation**: Upgrade triggers defined ($45/month when revenue justifies)
