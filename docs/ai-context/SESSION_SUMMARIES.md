# Cross-Session Memory & Summaries

## Recent Major Decisions

### Technology Stack Decision (September 2025)
**Decision**: Supabase FREE development stack approved by CTO
- **Rationale**: $0/month development costs, scale when revenue justifies
- **Previous Conflict**: NextAuth.js + Prisma vs Supabase Auth + PostgreSQL
- **Resolution**: CTO chose Supabase for integrated RLS and free tier benefits
- **Impact**: Enables immediate development without infrastructure costs

### Documentation Structure Refactor (Current Session)
**Decision**: Role-based AI context management system
- **Problem**: Documentation scattered, AI sessions losing context
- **Solution**: Dedicated context files for Claude Code/Desktop/Copilot
- **Implementation**: 4-phase migration plan with automated maintenance
- **Benefit**: Fresh AI sessions get full project context immediately

## Cross-Platform Context Coordination
**Claude Code ↔ Claude Desktop**: Shared understanding via business context
**All Platforms ↔ Copilot**: Consistent code patterns and technical standards
**Session Continuity**: Each platform updates their context before session end

## Key Project Milestones Achieved
- ✅ 15/15 customer interviews completed across 4 industry segments
- ✅ $50K development budget approved based on validation success
- ✅ Technology stack finalized (Supabase FREE tier approach)
