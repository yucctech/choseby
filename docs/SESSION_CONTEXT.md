# KRYVER SESSION CONTEXT
## Essential Guidelines for All AI Sessions (Claude Desktop + Claude Code)

### PROJECT STATUS
- **CRITICAL PIVOT**: From complex decision frameworks â†’ simple vendor comparison templates
- **Budget**: $15K max development (saving $20K from rejected approach)  
- **Timeline**: 4 months to paying customers
- **Customer Validation**: Based on Interview #9 healthcare feedback

### AI SESSION RULES
**NEVER create without permission:**
- summary.md, recap.md, session-summary.md
- test-results.md, analysis.md, findings.md  
- todo.md, next-steps.md, action-items.md
- Duplicate files with version numbers

**ALWAYS:**
- Check `docs/README.md` for current project handover status
- Reference `docs/stakeholder-collaboration-user-flow.md` for design specs
- Reference `docs/essential-business-data.md` for customer requirements
- Use specific, implementable recommendations
- Build what customers asked for, not what we think they need

### CURRENT FOCUS
**Design Phase**: Building wireframes for healthcare vendor selection workflow
**Next**: Customer validation testing with wireframes
**Goal**: Prove simple templates solve their "everyone has opinions but no clear framework" problem

### KEY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENT
*"Template that helps organize vendor comparisons consistently"* - Interview #9 healthcare operations manager

**Success = Customer says "This is exactly what we needed"**
