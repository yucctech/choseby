# CHOSEBY SESSION CONTEXT
## Essential Guidelines for All AI Sessions (Claude Desktop + Claude Code)

## ðŸš« CRITICAL AI BEHAVIOR RULES (READ FIRST)

### PROHIBITED AI BEHAVIORS - NEVER CREATE:
- `summary.md`, `recap.md`, `session-summary.md` or similar
- `test-results.md`, `analysis.md`, `findings.md`  
- `todo.md`, `next-steps.md`, `action-items.md`
- Duplicate files with version numbers (file-v2.md, file-final.md)
- Backup files (.bak, .old, .prev extensions)
- Temporary files (temp-, draft-, wip- prefixes)

### UPDATE-ONLY POLICY:
**AI must UPDATE existing files, not create new ones:**
- Update `operations/current-status.md` instead of creating status summaries
- Update domain files instead of creating separate analysis documents  
- Add to existing specifications instead of creating duplicate specs
- Append to existing ADRs instead of creating new decision records

### REQUIRED PERMISSION PROTOCOL:
**Before creating ANY new file, AI must:**
1. Check if existing file can be updated instead
2. Explicitly ask permission: "Should I create [filename] or update [existing-file]?"
3. Explain why a new file is necessary vs updating existing
4. Wait for explicit approval before file creation

## AI SESSION CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

### COMMUNICATION STYLE STANDARDS:
**Chat Responses**: Concise, actionable, role-appropriate
- Maximum 2-3 paragraphs for complex topics
- Direct recommendations with clear next steps
- Ask for approval before major work execution

**Documentation**: Detailed analysis and methodologies
- Store comprehensive content in docs folder
- Reference docs in chat, don't reproduce content
- Update existing files rather than creating redundant content

### PROJECT STATUS
- **CORE PRODUCT**: Customer Response Decision Intelligence Platform (strategic pivot complete)
- **CURRENT PHASE**: Technical Implementation Ready ($50K budget approved)
- **BUDGET**: $50K development budget with 8-week MVP timeline
- **TIMELINE**: Implementation ready, targeting 5 customer response teams
- **REVENUE TARGET**: $199-699/month per customer response team

### ðŸ“– TERMINOLOGY CLARIFICATION
**IMPORTANT**: "Phase" has TWO meanings in this project:

1. **IMPLEMENTATION PHASES** (Development Timeline):
   - IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 1: Core DECIDE Workflow (Screens 1-8) - Week 2-4
   - IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 2: Essential Support Features - Week 4-6
   - IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 3: Error Handling & Polish - Week 6-8

2. **DECIDE METHODOLOGY PHASES** (User Workflow):
   - Phase 1: Define the Problem (Screen 3)
   - Phase 2: Establish Criteria (Screen 4)
   - Phase 3: Consider Options (Screen 5)
   - Phase 4: Evaluate Anonymously (Screen 6)
   - Phase 5: Develop Action Plan (Screen 7)
   - Phase 6: Monitor Results (Screen 8)

Always clarify which "Phase" you're referring to in discussions.

### AI SESSION RULES
**NEVER create without permission:**
- summary.md, recap.md, session-summary.md
- test-results.md, analysis.md, findings.md  
- todo.md, next-steps.md, action-items.md
- Duplicate files with version numbers

**CLAUDE CODE vs DESKTOP TASK SEPARATION:**
- **Claude Code**: Any task involving programming languages (TypeScript, SQL, Python, etc.), coding, component creation, API development, database implementation, testing code
- **Claude Desktop**: Planning, documentation, wireframes, strategy, research, analysis, business logic design, user experience planning

**ALWAYS:**
- Check `docs/README.md` for current project direction
- Reference `docs/operations/current-status.md` for current phase
- Reference `docs/business/essential-business-data.md` for customer requirements
- Use specific, implementable recommendations
- Build what customers will pay premium prices for
- Separate coding tasks (Claude Code) from planning tasks (Claude Desktop)

### ROLE-BASED CONTEXT GUIDE
**AI should auto-select role and read appropriate context based on task type:**

#### Customer Development Specialist
**Task Triggers**: "interview", "validate", "customer feedback", "market research", "pricing", "concept testing"
**Context Files**: 
- `docs/business/` (all files)
- `docs/interviews/` (if available)
**Role Declaration**: "Role: Customer Development Specialist"
**Focus**: Validate AI platform concepts, test pricing acceptance, identify target customers

#### Technical Lead
**Task Triggers**: "wireframe", "build", "code", "architecture", "implementation", "technical", "development"
**Claude Code Tasks**: Any programming/coding tasks (TypeScript, SQL, React components, API development, database schema, testing code)
**Claude Desktop Tasks**: Technical planning, architecture documentation, wireframes, technical strategy
**Context Files**:
- `docs/technical/` (all files)  
- `wireframes/` folder
- `docs/archive/` (for reference designs)
**Role Declaration**: "Role: Technical Lead"
**Focus**: Prepare development based on validation results, design chosen concept, separate coding vs planning tasks

#### Strategic Advisor
**Task Triggers**: "budget", "strategy", "direction", "pivot", "business model", "roadmap", "timeline"
**Context Files**:
- `docs/operations/` (all files)
- `docs/business/strategy.md`
- `docs/README.md`
**Role Declaration**: "Role: Strategic Advisor"  
**Focus**: Business decisions, resource allocation, market strategy

### CURRENT FOCUS
**Implementation Phase**: Customer Response Decision Intelligence platform ready for Claude Code development
**Key Objective**: Build customer response team efficiency platform achieving $500+ MRR by Week 8
**Next**: Execute technical implementation from validated specifications

### CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING
**Strategic Pivot Complete**: Healthcare â†’ Customer Response Decision Intelligence  
**Implementation Ready**: Complete technical specifications validated for Claude Code development
**Goal**: Build customer response facilitation platform targeting customer-facing teams at $199-699/month

**Success = 5 customer response teams by Week 8, $500+ MRR through faster response times**
