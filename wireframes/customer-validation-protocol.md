**Follow-up questions**:

- 3 vendor options to evaluate
- 2-3 week decision timeline
- Real vendor comparison situation

### Wireframe Testing (30 minutes)

- "Does this feel too simple or too complex?"

**Success Indicator**: Completion in <30 minutes with positive engagement

#### Test 2: Screen 4 - Conflict Detection (10 minutes)
**Instructions**: "This shows conflicts between team members. In this example, the IT person wants direct integration while the admin person prioritizes cost savings."

- "Would identifying conflicts ahead of time help your decision process?"
- "Have you experienced similar priority mismatches?"
- "Would this reduce meeting time and arguments?"

**Success Indicator**: Recognition of value, relates to their experience

#### Test 3: Screen 6 - Executive Summary (5 minutes)
**Instructions**: "This is the final output for executives. It's automatically generated from the team evaluations."

**Key Questions**:
- "Is this the right format for your decision-makers?"
- "Too much detail or too little?"
- "Would your executives approve decisions based on this format?"
- "How does this compare to how you currently present vendor recommendations?"

**Success Indicator**: Confirms format works for their executives

### Value Recognition Testing (10 minutes)

#### Current vs New Process Comparison
**Questions**:
1. "How much time would this save vs your current process?"
2. "What's the biggest improvement you see?"
3. "What would concern you about adopting this approach?"
4. "Would this eliminate any current frustrations?"
5. "Could this prevent vendor selection mistakes?"

#### Political Neutrality Assessment
**Questions**:
1. "Would all team members feel comfortable using this together?"
2. "Does this create any unfair advantages for certain roles?"
3. "Would this reduce arguments during vendor selection?"
4. "Any concerns about team dynamics with this approach?"

### Pricing Validation (5 minutes)
**Context**: "This would be offered as an annual subscription for your organization."

**Questions**:
1. "What would you expect to pay for a solution like this annually?"
2. "How does $3,600 per year sound for your organization?"
3. "What would justify that investment?"
4. "How does that compare to consultant fees for similar decisions?"
5. "Would you need approval for this budget level?"
